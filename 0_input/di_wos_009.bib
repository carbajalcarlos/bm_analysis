Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an innovation technology for supply of computing as a
   utility towards digital world. It is provide platform and services for
   the massive- scale data storage and data sharing. Big Data on cloud
   environment analyze, storage, manage, visualization, security are some
   challenging techniques that requires more timing and large computation
   infrastructure processing. This paper mainly brush up for an era of 360
   degrees vision of massive data on cloud services computing. The meaning,
   taxonomy and literature reviews for some papers of cloud along with some
   big data model are introduced. The association and role of deluge
   computing and cloudy data, big data open sources tools are also
   discussed. Last but not least, research challenges and unsolved
   exploration problems are shortened.}},

   communities. In many developing countries, like Malawi, the assumption
   is that once telecentres are established, people will adopt them. The
   purpose of the study was to examine the factors influencing the use of
   telecentres in rural areas of developing countries by means of a case
   study of Lupaso Community Telecentre, in a remote region of Malawi.
   Following the example of a study of public computing facilities in Cape
   Town (Chigona \& Licker 2008), the study employed Rogers' Diffusion of
   Innovation (DOI) theory as a theoretical frame. Data were gathered
   through a mix of methodologies: questionnaires, interviews, observation,
   and records analysis. The study reveals that a large majority of users
   view the telecentre as an empowering project and are satisfied with its
   services. They perceive it to be improving human skills, helping the
   economy and strengthening the social capital of the surrounding
   community. However, it seems that the telecentre benefits only a small
   percentage of the community. Access is uneven. One surprising finding is
   that the centre's Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are
   not the chief attraction. The factors that negatively impact on the use
   of the ICTs are lack of internet searching skills, frequent electricity
   blackouts, lack of local content, and fees charged. To fulfil their
   mission, it is recommended that telecentres in developing communities
   enhance their services with information literacy and literacy education
   programmes.}},

   development model in the field of agricultural research and development,
   as a potential tool for upholding both public scientific research, and
   farmer-led innovation and farmers' rights. First, we provide an overview
   of the problems associated with the rise of IPRs in agriculture in view
   of global challenges such as food security and environmental
   sustainability, and present the debate on farmers' rights, including its
   rationale and international policy and legal responses. We then review
   open-source initiatives in the digital domain, including successes and
   shortcomings, and offer our understanding of relevant terminologies. We
   explore the parallels between software development and innovation in
   agriculture, review ongoing open source agriculture-related initiatives,
   and identify lessons learnt. We particularly assess the potential for
   open source systems to address existing asymmetries in capabilities and
   contribute to global challenges such as food security.}},

Abstract = {{Music and architecture have made use of mathematical proportions
   throughout the history for the purpose of creating acoustic and visual
   forms. The reason for this is the aesthetic pursuit of both disciplines
   since centuries. Mathematics is one of the most important factors that
   influence aesthetic results. While forming their abstract aesthetic
   compositions the musicians use the musical notes that have definite
   frequency values. Each of these frequency values are defined by one
   integer. Every classical music artist uses the fractal sequencing of
   these frequencies. On the other hand we encounter hundreds of silent
   formats which are produced using mathematical ideas. In this context if
   we think of the interdisciplinary interaction between music and
   architecture no form is ever silent. In this study, the intersection of
   two disciplines will be examined in the perspective of architecture; a
   stumper and interrogative start for pursuit of architectural forms of
   the present day with the transformation of auditory forms to visual
   forms will be made; and a basis will be provided to be able to discuss
   the innovations that the spaces, structures and auditory experiences
   which can be formed by obtaining musical codes bring. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{This article proposes a new methodology based on action-research for
   implementation of a business, system and technology model to assist and
   facilitate the collaborative use of resources and expertise, as well as
   to adjust one task force based on knowledge sharing and management. A
   case study is presented to illustrate the results of implementing the
   digital knowledge ecosystem framework in a research and development
   network of aerial application of pesticides for pest control, using the
   action-research approach. Results include the properties of
   self-management, open innovation, self-organisation of the
   institutionally linked groups and the adaptation of a new tool for
   collaboration, which can improve competitiveness. Its relevance may be
   measured by its benefits of capturing the sharing dynamics, processing
   and propagating information within the networks, allowing cooperation
   between organizations, measuring collective intelligence action and
   learning, as well as promoting survival such as minimum interaction
   rules, individual autonomy and organisational structure demand
   flexibility. Such arrangement proved to allow non-linear methods
   replacing attempts at objectivity, linear thought and control, and the
   design of risks in social computing system. The conclusions showed the
   opportunity to apply such model to other sectors related to agriculture
   and innovation and observe the challenge regarding to managerial
   indicators for future command and control of existing r\&d network
   knowledge management operations for future research.}},

   observed and new approaches to improve knowledge are now required.
   Therefore, studies on Big Data are being conducted to find innovative
   solutions as a means to analyze large data sets. In this work, we
   present a Big Data environment for agricultural soil analysis from
   computed tomography (CT) images. Our structure is planned in three
   layers: source; Big Data environment, and applications. We use Hadoop
   framework in the second layer to process CT images and discuss how the
   3D reconstruction is performed. Another application in the structure is
   the statistical analysis of soil samples. The Big Data environment is
   developed as a soil analysis system to gain an understand of the
   problems related to agricultural lands.}},

Abstract = {{Three-Dimensional Printing (3D Printing) is a technology that allows the
   production of physical objects from digital files. The increasing use of
   consumer 3D Printing technologies and services is prone to raise
   questions in relation to the intellectual property protection of digital

   Design Law framework to assess if it allows for the development of the
   technology, while protecting the legitimate interests of right holders.
   It concludes in favour of the need for slight clarifications to the law
   and recommends that right holders adapt their business models and search
   for innovative ways to benefit from the technology.}},

Abstract = {{E-books are made available in both Android and iOS platforms as
   increasingly, technology savvy readers choose to read digital e-books.
   E-book apps have transformed reading habits. The exponentially rising
   popularity of iOS and Android platforms is attributed to the incessant
   innovation of functions and appealing apps that are introduced every
   day. E-book apps are central to publishers worldwide to present
   prevailing content in an altogether interesting environment. In
   particular, many e-book application developers have chosen Apple's iOS
   mobile devices such as iPad, or iPhone as the target device to provide
   more creative and richer user experience, as evidenced by the rapidly
   increasing number of publication apps in Apple's App Store. In this
   paper, three major types of e-book apps from the App Store were examined
   from a developer's perspective to provide a focused overview of the
   status and trends of iOS e-book apps and an analysis of related
   technology, architecture, and user interface design issues. Three
   representative e-book apps were analyzed according to their purposes,
   functions, and user satisfaction, so that a user interface design
   guideline is established for developer implementation. It was clear that
   e-book apps still had plenty of room to grow to take full advantage of
   unique mobile platform features and truly fulfill their potential. In
   particular, introduction of two-or three-dimensional visualization and
   context awareness for the behavior component could further enhance
   e-book app's usability and utility. This paper aims to serve as a
   reference point and guide for developers and practitioners interested in
   using iOS as a platform for e-book applications, particularly from the
   technical perspective.}},

   a combined BeiDou Satellites System (BDS) and global positioning system
   (GPS) adaptive vector tracking loop is proposed. An adaptive extended
   Kalman filter (EKF) based on innovation sequences is employed to tune
   the tracking loop, and generate navigation solutions. The algorithms are
   implemented on Matlab software receiver and digital intermediate

Abstract = {{Smart Cities are a trend topic in urban planning as well as in the ICT
   sector. The cities integrate physical, digital and human systems to
   deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens.
   Many of these innovative solutions will be based on technological
   complexity, as well as the complexity of the various sectoral services
   involved within a Smart City, and require a system approach to
   standardization. Such an approach must promote the greatest possible
   reuse of existing open standards to accelerate the Smart City
   deployment. In an effort to tackle this issue, the Horizon 2020-project
   ESPRESSO (systEmic standardisation apPRoach to Empower Smart citieS and
   cOmmunities) will focus on the development of a conceptual Smart City
   Information Framework based on open standards within Europe. A further
   goal of ESPRESSO will be to envisage the impact of those technologies
   for urban planning and in societal terms. The partner cities will be
   engaged to analyze how their services can be improved and improved
   through large-scale use of standards. This will be done by analyzing,
   the downstream changes that the new scenarios enabled by large-scale
   interoperability and how they can be integrated in a future Smart City.
   Based on a detailed requirements-engineering campaign executed in close
   cooperation with cities, standardization organizations, administrative
   bodies, and private industry, the project will identify open standards
   matching the elicited requirements and will establish a baseline for
   interoperability between the various sectoral data sources and the Smart
   City enterprise application platform. In a comprehensive set of
   coordination, support and networking activities, the project will engage
   a very large number of stakeholders, such as Smart Cities (both existing
   and those with aspirations), European Standardization Organizations
   (ESOs), National Standardization Bodies (NSBs), Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs), public administrations, industries, SMEs, and
   other institutions.}},

   in this paper. It is first proved in {[}2] that Chrestenson transform of
   p-adic process is equivalent to K-L transform. We proposes a new method
   to generate the p-adic process from image data by extrapolating the data

Abstract = {{Electronic Health Records (EHR) are systematic collections of digital
   health information about individual patients or populations. They
   provide readily access to the complete medical history of the patient,
   which is useful for decision-making activities. In this paper we focus
   on a secondary benefit of EHR: the reuse of the implicit knowledge
   embedded in it to improve the knowledge on the mechanisms of a disease
   and/or the effectiveness of the treatments. In fact, all such patient
   data registries stored in EHR reflect implicitly different clinical
   decisions made by the clinical professionals that participated in the
   assistance of patients (e.g. criteria followed during decision making,
   patient parameters taken into account, effect of the treatments
   prescribed). This work proposes a methodology that allows the management
   of EHR not only as data containers and information repositories, but
   also as clinical knowledge repositories. Moreover, we propose an
   architecture for the extraction of the knowledge from EHR. Such
   knowledge can be fed into a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), in
   a way that could render benefits for the development of innovations from
   clinicians, health managers and medical researchers.}},

Abstract = {{A succession of data-bases, Advanced Information Processing (AIP) and
   Intelligent Decision-Making Technologies (IDT) have evolved rapidly over
   the past five decades. This cumulative evolution of Intelligent Decision
   Support Systems (IDSSs) has served to stimulate industrial activity and
   enhanced the lives of most people that the modern world. This
   publication highlights a series of current contributions to enhance the
   collective body of knowledge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques continue to be successfully
   employed to generate human-like decision-making, while simultaneously
   providing greater access to information to solve data intensive
   problems. This book documents innovative contributions that represent
   advances in Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering
   Systems. Newresearch recognises that society is familiar with modern AIP
   and increasingly expect richer IDT systems. Today there is a growing
   reliance on automatically processing information into knowledge with
   less human input. Society has already digitised its past and continues
   to progressively automate knowledge management for the future and
   increasingly expect to access this information using mobile devices.
   This book seeks to inform and enhance the exposure of research on
   intelligent systems and intelligence technologies that utilize novel and
   leading-edge techniques to improve decision-making. Each chapter
   concentrates on the theory, design, development, implementation, testing
   or evaluation of IDT techniques or applications. These approaches have
   the potential to support decision making in the areas of management,
   international business, finance, accounting, marketing, healthcare,
   production, networks, traffic management, crisis response, human
   interfaces and, military applications. All fourteen chapters represent a
   broad spread of topics across the domain and highlight how research is
   being realised to benefit society. Students, professionals and
   interested observers within the knowledge-based and intelligent
   information management domain will benefit from the diversity and
   richness of the content.}},

Title = {{The Development Model for Integrated Care: a validated tool for
   evaluation and development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Integrating health, social and informal care and seeking for
   new effective collaborations is a major topic in many countries, and
   requires innovation and improvement in current practices. Conceptual
   quality management models can facilitate practice improvement. However,
   a generic quality management model for integrated care was lacking. The
   purpose of this paper is to describe the results of multiple studies
   that resulted in a validated generic quality management model for
   integrated care. The Development Model for Integrated Care (DMIC) is the
   basis for a digital tool for self-evaluation and is being used in
   multiple ways in a large number of integrated care settings.
   Design/methodology/approach - A literature review, a Delphi study and
   concept mapping study were executed to identify the essential
   ingredients of integrated care. A next step was an expert study on the
   development process of integrated care over time. Lastly, a survey study
   in 84 integrated care networks was performed to empirically validate the
   model. Based on the model, a digital self-assessment tool was created to
   apply the model in practice.
   Findings - The studies showed that integrated care is a complex and
   multi-component concept but generic elements can be assessed. The
   literature and expert study resulted in a set of 89 elements of
   integrated care. The elements were grouped in nine clusters; ``quality
   care{''}, ``performance management{''}, ``inter-professional
   teamwork{''}, ``delivery system{''}, ``roles and tasks{''},
   ``patient-centredness{''}, ``commitment{''}, ``transparent
   entrepreneurship{''} and ``result-focused learning{''}. Four
   developmental phases named ``the initiative and design phase{''}, ``the
   experimental and execution phase{''}, `` the expansion and monitoring
   phase{''} and `` the consolidation and transformation phase{''} were
   found. The findings showed that the model is applicable for multiple
   integrated care settings.
   Research limitations/implications - The DMIC has the potential to serve
   as a research framework for integrated care, and the use as an
   evaluation tool on multiple levels. Further research is suggested about
   more explicitly involving the perspectives of clients, research on the
   involvement of multiple stakeholders and their professional backgrounds
   and the use of the model in other countries.
   Practical implications - The DMIC is the basis of a digital web-based
   assessment tool, which is being used in the Netherlands in multiple
   integrated care settings. Applying the tool helps in assessing the
   current state of integrated care practice and defining suggestions for
   further improvement and development. It is also being used to benchmark
   multiple settings and is adopted in guidelines or care standards for
   integrated care.
   Originality/value - A generic conceptual and validated model that can be
   supportive for integrated care practices, policy and research was
   lacking. The results of the summarized studies in this paper present
   such a conceptual model for integrated care and gives suggestions for
   further use in an international audience. Results in a Canadian study
   showed that the model can also be used in other settings and countries.
   This contributes to the opportunities for use of the model in integrated
   care practice, policy and research also in other countries.}},

Title = {{Knowledge management for library building design}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{2-12}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In the digital age, constant changes in libraries inform
   contemporary building design. An innovative library building design is a
   complicated process and can be viewed as a continuous process of the use
   of tacit and explicit knowledge and innovative tools and approaches.
   Knowledge management (KM) can bring about the much needed innovation,
   and transform tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge. For the design of a
   library to be successful, it is necessary to apply KM to library
   building design. The purpose of this paper is to look at key change
   impacts, to explore how to manage knowledge in building design and to
   identify key design principles.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper looks at key change impacts,
   explores how to manage knowledge in library building design and
   pinpoints design principles.
   Findings - This paper finds that KM can be vital to library building
   design, and it can be used in all stages: to examine the internal and
   external environments, transform tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge
   by using portals, and analyze existing and future issues and trends.
   When effectively used, KM will result in innovative design strategies
   and also will reduce the time and costs of the building design and plan
   processes. The main principles of library building design are
   flexibility, accessibility, safety and security, applicability,
   adaptability, efficiency, and sustainability.
   Practical implications - This paper provides a useful overview of how to
   manage knowledge in library building design and design principles.
   Originality/value - The views, discussions, and suggestions will be of
   value to improve the effectiveness of library building design.}},

Title = {{The technologies of distance: new migrations in Conor O'Callaghan's The
   Sun King}},
Journal = {{IRISH STUDIES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{275-290}},
Abstract = {{This article analyses Conor O'Callaghan's collection The Sun King as an
   expression of contemporary migration practices. It places the poet's
   technological mobilities within larger global movements and argues that
   the collection reconfigures poetic versions of migration for the
   twenty-first century. The Sun King (2013) is located in explicitly
   transient spaces, while its formal innovations serve to mimeticise
   contemporary dislocation. In reinventing the dual demands of memory and
   migration in the postmodern society, The Sun King recognises and pursues
   alternative poetic possibilities. The article suggests that
   O'Callaghan's Twitter-poem ``The Pearl Works{''} can be read as
   indicative of an expansive impulse towards ephemeral online works. In
   particular, the article raises questions around composition, stability
   and memory practices in the digital era, and highlights how both
   migration and memory are complicated by technological innovations.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{323-332}},
Abstract = {{The social media site (SMS) Facebook can provide social workers with a
   method to engage in informal peer support. Scholars to date have mainly
   focused on SMSs such as Facebook as they pertain to clinical
   interactions with clients, maintaining professionalism especially among
   social work students, using them for professional or organizational
   promotion, and using them as an educational tool. Informal peer groups
   have been found to be an effective tool to combat burnout in high-stress
   professions such as social work. The use of a SMS such as Facebook for
   informal peer support could provide additional benefits to social
   workers beyond what they would experience from offline contact. This
   article fills a gap in the literature by describing how a group of
   practicing social workers use a private Facebook group for peer support,
   informal consultation, emotional support, and personal social
   connection. Given the continual high rates of job stress and burnout,
   social workers should consider new and innovative ways to use SMSs such
   as Facebook to enhance their self-care efforts.}},

   industry has an increasingly multicultural and multilingual workforce,

   effectiveness. CodeSafe Solutions, has developed an innovative method of
   communicating H\&S information to field-based workers using digital
   media. The potential of the system was explored and two organizations in
   the Australian construction industry were used. Qualitative data from
   in-depth interviews of safety managers and workers involved in system
   implementation and quantitative data such as incident reports and video
   usage were analysed. Managers perceived the CodeSafe system to be
   beneficial and well received by workers. In one organization, the
   introduction of the CodeSafe system coincided with a reduction in injury
   rates. However, causal inferences about the impact of the system cannot
   be made. Workers involved in making the films believed films would be an
   effective communication tool. However, barriers to implementation of the
   technology include workers' reluctance to use personal smart phones,
   limited internet connectivity, and organizational and national
   regulations on mobile phone use on construction sites.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Location Based Services (LBSs) has been widely used these
   days due to the emerging business market, which include a lot of
   services such as emergency services, tracking assets, etc. With the
   introduction wireless networks and the growing number of wireless
   devices are all putting tremendous stress on legacy 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi
   networks. With new innovations that allow for more reliable coverage,
   802.11ac Wi-Fi technology addresses many challenges, allowing mobile
   device users to stream digital content between devices faster, and
   simultaneously connect more wireless devices to home and enterprise
   networks, while conserving battery power. Considerable interests have
   been introduced for its capabilities to provide localization in indoor
   environments. 802.11ac Wi-Fi technology operates using fine timing
   resolution technology, resulting in highly accurate positioning
   regardless of environmental factors. Previous versions of indoor
   positioning relied on received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
   technology, where signal strength and performance can vary depending on
   environmental factors such as crowd density or temperature.
   In this paper, we propose a super-resolution ranging measurements
   technique using Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) which can be used in
   802.11ac Wi-Fi networks. This super-resolution ranging measurements are
   based on estimating the time of flight (or its differences) as measured
   via Direct Path (DP) from the transmitter to the receiver. Simulation
   testing is provided to show the improvements of the proposed approach
   over the conventional ranging estimation approaches.
   We explain the shortcomings of the conventional ranging estimation in
   legacy Wi-Fi localization approaches. These shortcomings arise when
   Line-Of-Sight (LOS) measurements from the transmitter to the receiver is
   followed closely by a number of multipath signals which arrive at the
   receiver end within a short time delay. Given that this delay can be
   smaller than the duration of the Rayleigh resolution of the system, the
   LOS signal and the multipath signals will suffer from overlapping and
   consequently introducing a bias in the time delay estimated by the peak
   detector. To overcome this problem, several super-resolution estimation
   algorithms have been introduced and classified as Least Squares (LS) and
   subspace methods.
   As for the LS methods, when the LOS signal and the multipath signals are
   spaced closer than the Rayleigh resolution, significant additional
   errors will exist due to the noise enhancement that arises from the
   ill-conditioned nature of the matrices that are involved in the LS
   operation. Therefore, sub-space methods have been introduced to overcome
   the noise enhancement problem related to LS methods.
   Sub-space methods are based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   algorithm which splits the received signal into two orthogonal subspaces
   known as the signal subspace and the noise subspace using spectral (or
   Eigen) decomposition. However, if the received LOS signal and multipath
   signals are partially correlated, which is the case in closely spaced
   multipath signals, the Eigen value matrix is no longer diagonal (i.e.
   becomes defective), and therefore the received signal cannot be
   reconstructed due to the shortage of Eigen vectors which affects the SVD
   algorithm performance. In this paper, the correlation between closely
   spaced signals has been investigated.
   We propose a multi-resolution orthogonal search in the signal subspace
   in addition to projecting the received signal into two orthogonal
   sub-spaces: signal and noise. The proposed approach provides that the
   correlated rays are projected into different orthogonal bases.
   The Mean Square Error (MSE) is minimized to evaluate the contribution of
   the resolved signal(s) such that the sufficiency of the proposed
   multi-resolution orthogonal search, at each step is satisfied. Fast
   orthogonal search is employed in this process. Assessment of the
   proposed method in resolving correlated multipath signals is
   investigated through lab testing results to compare the probability of
   detection/resolution of the multi-resolution technique to conventional
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: This article presents a multimodal analysis of
   startle type responses using a variety of physiological, facial, and
   speech features. These multimodal components of the startle type
   response reflect complex brain-body reactions to a sudden and intense
   stimulus. Additionally, the proposed multimodal evaluation of reflexive
   and emotional reactions associated with the startle eliciting stimuli
   and underlying neural networks and pathways could be applied in
   diagnostics of different psychiatric and neurological diseases.
   Different startle type stimuli can be compared in the strength of their
   elicitation of startle responses, i.e. their potential to activate
   stress-related neural pathways, underlying biomarkers and corresponding
   behavioral reactions.
   Methods: An innovative method for measuring startle type responses using
   multimodal stimuli and multimodal feature analysis has been introduced.
   Individual's multimodal reflexive and emotional expressions during
   startle type elicitation have been assessed by corresponding
   physiological, speech and facial features on ten female students of
   psychology. Different startle eliciting stimuli like noise and airblast
   probes, as well as a variety of visual and auditory stimuli of different
   valence and arousal levels, based on International Affective Picture
   System (LAPS) images and/or sounds from International Affective
   Digitized Sounds (TADS) database, have been designed and tested.
   Combined together into more complex startle type stimuli, such composite
   stimuli can potentiate the evoked response of underlying neural
   networks, and corresponding neurotransmitters and neuromodulators as
   well; this is referred to as increased power of response elicitation.
   The intensity and magnitude of multimodal responses to selected startle
   type stimuli have been analyzed using effect sizes and medians of
   dominant multimodal features, i.e. skin conductance, eye blink, head
   movement, speech fundamental frequency and energy. The significance of
   the observed effects and comparisons between paradigms were evaluated
   using one-tailed t-tests and ANOVA methods, respectively. Skin
   conductance response habituation was analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc
   multiple comparison tests with the Dunn-Sidak correction.
   Results: The results revealed specific physiological, facial and vocal
   reflexive and emotional responses on selected five stimuli paradigms
   which included: (1) acoustic startle probes, (2) airblasts, (3) LAPS
   images, (4) LADS sounds, and (5) image-sound-airblast composite stimuli.
   Overall, composite and airblast paradigms resulted in the largest
   responses across all analyzed features, followed by sound and acoustic
   startle paradigms, while paradigm using images consistently elicited the
   smallest responses. In this context, power of response elicitation of
   the selected stimuli paradigms can be described according to the
   aggregated magnitude of the participants' multimodal responses. We also
   observed a habituation effect only in skin conductance response to
   acoustic startle, airblast and sound paradigms.
   Conclusions: This study developed a system for paradigm design and
   stimuli generation, as well as real-time multimodal signal processing
   and feature calculation. Experimental paradigms for monitoring
   individual responses to stressful startle type stimuli were designed in
   order to compare the response elicitation power across various stimuli.
   The developed system, applied paradigms and obtained results might be
   useful in further research for evaluation of individuals' multimodal
   responses when they are faced with a variety of aversive emotional
   distractors and stressful situations.}},

Title = {{A process model for bricolage-based resource co-management for a
   resource-constrained government IT project Lessons learned from Taiwan's
   DOC project}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{200-220}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which
   central government in resource-constrained environments collaborates
   with local government to utilize the available resources at hand to set
   up 300 Digital Opportunity Centers (DOCs) in 168 remote areas in Taiwan
   through co-management to bricolage new resources and new capabilities,
   gradually bridging the urban-rural digital divide to co-create values
   for local development.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted an in-depth case study.
   The authors selected Taiwan's DOC, the largest public information
   service infrastructure project in Taiwan, to explore issues related to
   bricolage-based resource co-management.
   Findings - From the integrating relevant literature, the generic process
   of bricolage-based resource co-management can be inferred to consist of
   four major steps. Applying this body of knowledge as a theoretical lens
   to analyze the case of Taiwan's DOC, a process model of bricolage-based
   resource co-management is inductively derived to address the research
   questions.
   Research limitations/implications - A common criticism of this
   methodology is its lack of generalizability since a case study cannot
   prove itself in a statistical sense.
   Practical implications - This study is significant in that it provides a
   comprehensive and empirically supported framework. The authors hope that
   practitioners who face resource constraints when conducting large-scale
   IT projects can use the process model developed in this study as a
   detailed roadmap to identify the most appropriate actions and steps to
   undertake.
   Originality/value - This study provides an empirically grounded
   framework that contributes toward addressing the lack of empirical
   studies in bricolage-based, resource co-management research.}},

Abstract = {{Within the orthodontic field, malocclusion problems are usually treated
   by using different types of appliances. In particular, Eruption Guidance
   Appliances (EGAs) are recommended for early orthodontic treatment or
   prevention of malocclusion problems. The traditional approach with EGAs
   is based on the use of standard prefabricated appliances. Experts in the
   orthodontic field believe that the customization of the EGAs would
   strongly enhance the results of malocclusion treatments.
   This paper presents an innovative methodology for the design and
   manufacturing of fully customized EGAs. The methodology is based on an
   extensive integration between traditional orthodontic procedures with
   advanced computer aided design processes. The methodology moves from the
   digitalization of the plaster models obtained by optical scanning
   techniques. The patient morphology is then exploited, under dental
   practitioner supervision, for the design of the appliance geometry
   through CAD modeling tools. Medical guided assessment is required
   throughout the most of the data elaboration processes, in order to
   design the EGAs accordingly to the patient's clinical conditions.
   Low-pressure injection molds for the physical manufacturing of the
   appliances are then 3D printed by using rapid prototyping techniques.
   The proposed methodology allows the production of patient customized
   appliances guaranteeing low cost manufacturing and high quality
   standards, similar to those typically obtained by in series productions.
   Moreover, the presented approach offers a high integration level with
   numerical and finite element methods, which can be used for evaluating
   the stress applied on the EGA, thus allowing the reinforcement of the
   appliance prior its manufacturing.}},

Title = {{An exploratory conceptualization of consumer design perception for
   digital devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{143-163}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Despite the volume of work on the subject, product design and
   its conceptualization has remained relatively abstract. There is hardly
   any discussion about the holistic meaning of design, especially with
   regards to its meaning for a user. This paper aims to explore consumer
   design perception to provide it a multidimensional definition and
   measure that is more relevant to industrial designers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study was done in two qualitative
   phases: the first to generate and confirm the design dimensions
   pre-conceived from literature, corroborated with consumer voices; and
   the second to include gamified depth interviews triangulated with
   conventional depth interviews and word association-based correspondence
   analysis to generate items that can measure each of those dimensions.
   Findings - The first study confirms five dimensions of consumer design
   perception: visual, functional, kinesthetic, interface and information.
   Following the second phase, the study proposes five items for visual
   design, seven for functional design, three for kinesthetic design, four
   for interface design and five for information design.
   Research limitations/implications - Though through multiple qualitative
   studies, combined with literary evidence, this work provides reasonable
   qualitative validity to the findings, a semiotic analysis-based
   methodologies that can further concretize, if not refute, the findings.
   Rooted in the theory of design value, the study explores transformation
   of design values, from the designer's domain to that of a consumer.
   While each of the design constructs has gone through a thorough
   investigation in literature, this work is the first to provide a unified
   theory of consumer design perception.
   Practical implications - Designers have long struggled to know what
   consumers want. There is a clear divide in designers and consumers'
   meanings of design. This study attempts to bridge this divide. Items
   measuring each construct should enable them in tweaking their offerings
   to a consumer's liking.
   Originality/value - Design is an abstract term and can be applied by a
   designer or a consumer. Dimensionalization of this complex term for
   better understanding using innovative qualitative tools serves as an
   original contribution to field of design research.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to provide more insight in the
   ways key users act as knowledge managers and boundary spanners during
   the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system usage phase. Despite the
   recognized importance of key users during the implementation phase of an
   ERP system, little is known about their role in the ERP usage phase.
   Design/methodology/approach - To provide rich insight in the
   boundary-spanning mechanisms utilized by key users to share knowledge, a
   qualitative approach was applied. In this study, ``abductive{''} theme
   coding for 58 interviews with key users, end-users and managers has been
   used. This paper found six mechanisms and characterized them as
   ``crossing{''} structural, social or cognitive boundaries.
   Findings - Six boundary-spanning mechanisms have been distinguished
   which have been applied by key users to overcome several knowledge
   management issues. Subsequently, these mechanisms lead to a model which
   describes three different roles that key users may fulfill to
   efficiently share and transfer knowledge during the ERP usage phase.
   Research limitations/implications - Knowledge barriers during an ERP
   implementation and their accompanying six boundary-crossing mechanisms
   have been distinguished.
   Practical implications - The recognition of the essential role that key
   users can fulfill during the usage phase of an ERP system is an
   important implication. Management has to take into account that tasks
   and responsibilities of key users have to be clear from the start and
   they may cautiously select employees who are suited to become key users.
   Originality/value - The main contribution is the importance of the
   impact of key users on the effectivity of knowledge management during
   the ERP usage phase.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - It is a commonplace that innovation in the digital economy is
   now driven by data. Business organizations, media companies, and
   government, for example all create economic and societal value from the
   digital traces left by the user population. At the same time the data
   captured also contains information that personally identifies consumers,
   citizens and patients as individuals. The purpose of this paper is to
   place this new form of data work in the context of previous approaches
   to information work; to identify the differences between information and
   data work and the resulting challenges for data professionals.
   Design/methodology/approach - Informed by a review of previous
   approaches to information work, the paper argues that the shift in value
   from information to data as an economic asset and a societal good
   entails a new form of human-oriented data work. One that is more
   sensitive to the contextual conditions and consequences of the capture,
   processing and use of data than has been the case hitherto. The
   implications of this for a shift in emphasis from the data scientist to
   the data professional is addressed, as are emerging issues of governance
   and ethics.
   Findings - The main consequence for data professionals is to ensure that
   processes are in place not only to enable the creation of valued
   products and services from data, but also to mitigate the risks related
   to their development. The paper argues that ensuring this involves
   taking a contextual view that locates data processing within the user,
   governance, legal, and ethical conditions related to data work. The
   consequences for the governance of data, and the education of data
   professionals are addressed.
   Originality/value - The value of the paper rests in its development of
   an analytical and methodologically driven framework, that places new
   forms of data work in the context of their conditions and consequences.
   The framework builds on prior approaches to information work, current
   approaches to data work, and addresses the governance, and educational
   challenges arising from organizations' emphasis on data-driven
   innovation in a digital economy.}},

Abstract = {{Quartz Crystal based oscillators, specifically Oven Controlled X'tal
   Oscillators (OCXO), continue to dominate applications that require high
   quality factor and high stability. The complexity of the
   thermo-mechanical design, the intricacies of manufacturing low profile
   solutions with reliable discrete components and the laborious testing
   and qualification process add cost to an OCXO. The reliability of these
   devices is extremely challenging since OCXOs operate at high internal
   temperatures continually over their lifetime. Recent developments in
   OCXO technology using Integrated Circuits are breakthroughs in the
   industry allowing significant reduction in manufacturing complexity
   which in turn significantly improves reliability. In addition, an
   IC-based OCXOs reduce the overall size and power requirements compared
   to traditional discrete OCXO designs.
   Introduction of Digital Signal Processing Techniques is improving OCXO
   performance by an order of magnitude compared to similar traditional
   OCXO package profiles. The knowledge and experience in oscillator design
   over many decades are now being transferred into the digital domain,
   thanks to the powerful processing engines which make it possible.
   Residual thermal effects, hysteresis, power supply variations and other
   system effects can now be compensated while the system is in operation.
   Ageing of the system, measured against a known reference, can also be
   corrected on the oscillator level. Support for system level signals like
   1 Pulse Per Second (1pps) input and output in an OCXO can ease system
   integration challenges. Such system level support functions simplify the
   complexity of characterization of the equipment (e.g. Temperature
   Cycling and Ageing characterization) and saves cost.
   There are a number of applications that demand extreme operating
   temperatures and Oven Control methods have traditionally been limited in
   achieving such temperatures. Innovative crystal cuts and new thermally
   insensitive components are being evaluated as potential solutions. There
   is also development in lower cost Temperature Controlled X'tal
   Oscillator (TCXO) technology to improve stability. Techniques that are
   used in the Oven Control methods are being applied in temperature
   compensation to further reduce the residual effects and achieve
   performance in a low-power TCXO that is comparable to some higher cost
   OCXO.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging Liquid-Sensing Enterprise (LSE) concept provides to
   manufacturing enterprises the required enablers to modernize traditional
   strategies for product design and validation. The proposed osmosis
   processes integrates innovative processes and paradigms comprising a
   MDA/MDI based approach with the focus to potentiate the generation of
   technological innovations. These osmosis processes address the existing
   real, digital and virtual related data of specific products design
   supported by sensing assets to facilitate ready-to-run business
   processes, to then perform efficient product development and validation.
   This paper integrates model-driven techniques and runtime environments
   as well as novel form of information access and visualization for
   systems design and process development. The developments are accompanied

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) is an innovative display technology that is
   finding applications in various academic disciplines and professional
   settings. AR can be used to create immersive experiences by overlaying
   virtual objects over real-world environments. Its versatility and
   astonishing capabilities have led to its widespread use in journalism
   and advertising. The authors of this paper have been researching
   perceptions and usability of AR for several years, focusing particularly
   on print media, a publishing sector whose precarious situation means it
   needs to consider the potential of emerging technologies. The
   methodology is based on questionnaires and surveys to gather data from
   future communications professionals, following interactive
   demonstrations of AR. The quantitative data obtained was then processed
   statistically. Subsequent data analysis revealed that AR is viewed
   positively by respondents, and seen to hold significant potential for
   the needs of the communications industry.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, in 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older,
   were overweight. Of these, over 600 million were obese. Accurately
   documenting dietary caloric intake is crucial to manage weight loss, but
   also presents challenges because most of the current methods for dietary
   assessment must rely on memory to recall foods eaten. The ultimate goal
   of our research is to develop computer-aided technical solutions to
   enhance and improve the accuracy of current measurements of dietary
   intake. Our proposed system in this paper aims to improve the accuracy
   of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images captured by mobile
   devices (e.g., smartphone). The key technique innovation in this paper
   is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms.
   Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately
   estimates dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages
   over other methods. However, how to derive the food information (e.g.,
   food type and portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently
   remains a challenging and open research problem. We propose a new
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based food image recognition
   algorithm to address this problem. We applied our proposed approach to
   two real-world food image data sets (UEC-256 and Food-101) and achieved
   impressive results. To the best of our knowledge, these results
   outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets. Our
   experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising
   solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future
   work includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and
   integrating our system into a real-world mobile and cloud
   computing-based system to enhance the accuracy of current measurements
   of dietary intake.}},

Pages = {{71-82}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the use of iMindMap
   software as an interactive tool in the teaching and learning method and
   also to be able to consider iMindMap as an alternative instrument in
   achieving the ultimate learning outcome.
   Design/methodology/approach - Out of 268 students of the management
   accounting at the University of Technology MARA (Terengganu), 97
   students have participated in this survey to evaluate the effectiveness
   of iMindMap in teaching and learning.
   Findings - Results indicate that the majority of the students
   acknowledged that iMindMap is more attractive than conventional teaching
   methods and found that iMindMap shows clearly how the points are all
   associated and linked together. Students could find that learning is an
   exciting experience and were able to visualize the whole course content
   remarkably via iMindMap.
   Originality/value - This study presents an alternative instrument, which
   is innovative and interactive in teaching and learning, especially for
   accounting students where the students' technology acceptance could also
   be viewed.}},

Abstract = {{The American multinational company Google is one of the most important
   businesses in the new economy, thanks to its innovation has positioned
   itself as a leader in the Internet environment worldwide. One of its
   main products is Google Search, which has been in the public eye,
   because authorities in antitrust considered that search machine
   infringes the antitrust legal system. The company Google has faced
   indictments for this reason countries like the US and the EU, but in
   both cases it is considered that the authorities responsible for
   research has not given clear and sound criteria to determine the guilt
   or innocence of the digital enterprise, based on the actual behavior of
   competition in the markets for electronic commerce, which belong to the
   new Economy, so this article presents a brief description of both cases
   and proposals of the key aspects that investigations by the authorities

Abstract = {{Purpose - A number of subject-orientated and general websites have
   emerged to host academic resources. The purpose of this paper is to
   evaluate the uptake of such services in order to decide which depositing
   strategies are effective and should be encouraged.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper evaluates the views and shares
   of resources in the generic repository Figshare by subject category and
   resource type.
   Findings - Figshare use and common resource types vary substantially by
   subject category but resources can be highly viewed even in subjects
   with few members. More active subject areas do not tend to have more
   viewed or shared resources.
   Research limitations/implications - The view counts and share counts
   analysed may reflect author accesses or may be spammed.
   Practical implications - Limited uptake of Figshare within a subject
   area should not be a barrier to its use. Several highly successful
   innovative uses for Figshare show that it can reach beyond a purely
   academic audience.
   Originality/value - This is the first analysis of the uptake and use of
   a generic academic resource sharing repository.}},

Abstract = {{The digital factory with its innovative tools is experiencing an
   increasing importance, not only in experimental but also productive
   domains. One of these tools is the digital human model (DHM). In the
   field of production, the focus of using DHMs lies in the planning and
   evaluation of processes and products in terms of plausibility,
   productivity and ergonomics.
   Up to now, ergonomic assessment within DHM simulations have been mostly
   limited to static evaluations of reachability and postures.
   INTERACT is a running R\&D project, working on the main weak points of
   DHM software tools. The industry-driven requirements are mainly the
   reduction of input effort, the increase of movement quality and a quick
   and intuitive way to create simulation variations in a workshop
   environment.
   The utilization of sensor data to create high quality simulations is
   another point of development.
   Next to the addressed improvement in productivity and plausibility,
   these latest advancements also enable automatic ergonomic assessments,
   including process oriented standards like EAWS, OCRA and NIOSH lifting
   index. The inclusion of these standards will allow a more holistic
   ergonomic assessment and therewith expand the fields of application in
   the industrial environment.
   This paper will give an insight in the latest developments and the
   performance of current implementations of automatic ergonomic assessment
   within digital human models. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The European manufacturing sectors have to face the challenge of
   workplace safety and security representing costs up to 4\% of GNP. A
   user-friendly and cooperative human-robotic exoskeleton for manual
   handling work can represent a possible innovative solution. For
   highlighting and revealing the benefits of human-robotic exoskeleton,
   represented by increased employment and productivity and reduced back
   injuries, the validation of this concept in digital and virtual
   environment has been performed, in two relevant industry sectors, car
   disassembly and automotive suppliers. The digital models of the test
   cases and the simulation of ergonomic workplaces were realized by using
   state-of-the-art Digital Manufacturing technologies and systems. This
   simulation technology allowed the realization of two states of factory
   environment, the ``as-is{''} state without an exoskeleton and the to-be
   state after employing the use of an exoskeleton. The challenges of
   coupling the exoskeleton to the human operators in Digital Manufacturing
   Systems, the first results and the next steps, are presented as well.

Abstract = {{The actual main target for manufacturing systems is the constant
   research of new technologies and solutions to implement lean processes
   gaining flexibility along assembly lines. An important approach to
   correctly investigate in this direction is the analysis of the human
   interaction with the workplace and the assigned activities or, in other
   words, the ergonomic aspects. In the past a lot of efforts have been
   already spent to increase comfort and safety of human operations.
   Nowadays also the ageing factor of blue collars, especially in Western
   Europe, is not at all a negligible problem. Requirements as ``more
   flexibility{''} and ``reduced time to market{''} imply a faster and easy
   capacity to analyze impacts of new products and processes on workers
   healthy condition already before the first production trial. Electrolux
   is participating in the EU funded project INTERACT to develop and adopt
   a user friendly tool simulating the manufacturing process and getting a
   precise ergonomic analysis before having at disposal any physical
   prototypes to perform the assessment. For the ergonomic analysis the
   specific case is the material handling operations, starting from the
   supplier delivery till the refurbishment of assembly stations. The
   target is to identified and prevent, using standard methods (NIOSH) and
   index (OCRA), eventual ergonomic hazards in pre-assigned movements
   (picking, handling, loading, etc..) also comparing alternative
   solutions. Operating in advance in a ``fully virtual world{''} using
   only 3D drawings, it will be possible to simulate in few minutes any
   working operation and to get the relevant ergonomic evaluation. It also
   will be possible to get real time analyses of already existing
   activities, simply using standard cameras and without any impact on the
   workers privacy. Such an innovative way of analysis will allow an
   immediate understanding of any work-related physical disease and
   selecting a better solution for both random and mass working operations.

Abstract = {{The chairside fabrication of a monolithic partial crown using a
   zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) ceramic is described. The

Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to share lessons already learned
   and work currently in progress from one higher education institution's
   experiences of developing several flexible and technology-enhanced
   active learning spaces. It further proposes that the potential of such
   spaces can be more fully realised through the enactment of programmes of
   digital literacy development amongst their users.
   Design/methodology/approach - In identifying a convergence of profound
   challenges facing higher education and proposing that innovations in
   physical learning spaces are one approach to addressing such challenges,
   the paper examines a number of institutional policies and initiatives
   for rethinking and redesigning several physical classroom environments.
   It sets internal findings and position statements amidst a broader
   context of relevant field literature.
   Findings - The paper provides insights from several years of experience
   in higher education learning space development, including the benefits
   of iterative experimentation, the consultative role of a
   multistakeholder specialist group, the challenges of balancing pedagogic
   need with often conflicting institutional requirements and the value of
   varied programmes of staff development.
   Originality/value - This paper's insights will be of value to
   individuals and institutions engaged in reconsidering their provision of
   physical classroom spaces in higher education and to those promoting the
   effective use of learning spaces in the digital university.}},

Abstract = {{For centuries the circulation of texts of national literatures has been
   ruled by power institutions linked to the political and cultural elites.
   The academy, the school and publishers have established a canon, i.e., a
   selection of readings that every reader should know. In the world
   context, the canon also reflects power relations: literatures from
   hegemonic countries and languages have enjoyed far greater diffusion and
   influence than subaltern literatures. In the current context of Internet
   the traditional dynamic of literary texts circulation is changing thanks
   to the progressive empowerment of creators and readers. In our article
   we will demonstrate how new home-made creations, practices and attitudes
   that link poetry and digital technology are leading to a new circulation
   of literary heritage and the emergence of new genres that make up
   promising scenarios based on greater freedom, cultural wealth and
   equity.}},

Title = {{Di-Calcium Phosphate and Phytosphingosine as an Innovative
   Acid-Resistant Treatment to Occlude Dentine Tubules}},
Journal = {{CARIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{303-309}},
Abstract = {{The present investigation evaluated the ability of an experimental
   di-calcium phosphate (DCP) desensitising agent used alone or combined
   with phytosphingosine (PHS) to occlude dentine tubules and resist a
   citric acid (CA) or artificial saliva (AS) challenge. Three groups of
   human dentine specimens (DS) were treated with the following: (1) PHS
   alone, (2) DCP or (3) a combination of PHS and DCP. Dentine hydraulic
   conductance of DS was evaluated using a digital flow sensor at 6.9 kPa.
   The average fluid volume for each of the treated DS was used to
   calculate the total dentine permeability reduction (\% P) prior to and
   following CA immersion for 1 min or AS immersion for 4 weeks. The
   treated DS were subjected to both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. Statistically
   significant differences (\% P) were identified between the groups by
   ANOVA and Fisher's multiple comparison test p < 0.05), respectively.
   Interestingly, both PHS and DCP appeared to work synergistically. DS
   treated with DCP or PHS/DCP demonstrated a significant reduction (\% P)
   prior to and following CA or AS challenge (p < 0.05). Both the SEM and
   FTIR analyses showed consistent brushite crystals occluding the dentine
   tubules. Conversely, the application of PHS alone failed to demonstrate
   any significant reduction of dentine permeability (p > 0.05) or show any
   evidence of occlusion of the dentine tubules. DCP can be used alone or
   combined with PHS to decrease the dentine permeability as well as to
   resist a CA and AS challenge. These results would, therefore, suggest
   that DCP may be a suitable treatment option for dentine
   hypersensitivity. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Title = {{Development of Telscreen: a telephone-based speech-in-noise hearing
   screening test with a novel masking noise and scoring procedure}},

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{463-471}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In 2006 the National Acoustic Laboratories was commissioned
   to create a telephone-based hearing screening test. Design: NAL
   developed Telscreen', a speech-in-noise test modelled on the Dutch and
   UK telephone tests. The first version, Telscreen I, had several novel
   features: individual scoring of digits; individual equalization of digit
   intelligibility; and accuracy-determined test termination. Evaluation of
   Telscreen I revealed that it did not discriminate satisfactorily between
   those with and without hearing impairment. Subsequently Telscreen II,
   which included a novel sensitized masking noise, was developed. Study
   sample: Telscreen I was evaluated by 105 participants (22-86 years),
   37\% with normal hearing (all thresholds<20dB HL in the test ear), 63\%
   with hearing impairment (all thresholds>20dB HL in the test ear).
   Telscreen II was evaluated by 75 participants (25-86 years), 33\% with
   normal hearing, 67\% with hearing impairment. Results: Correlations
   between Telscreen I results and hearing thresholds, r=0.57, and hearing
   disability scores, r=0.51 were highly significant, but lower than
   expected. Correlations for Telscreen II were higher: r=0.77 and 0.65,
   respectively. Telscreen II was found to have high sensitivity: 90\%; and
   specificity: 90.2\%. Conclusions: Telscreen II is an efficient,
   reliable, and innovative hearing screening test that provides a solid
   foundation for future tests delivered via mobile and internet
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of modern advanced science and technology,
   advanced science and technology affects our life style and production
   mode in various ways, and the rapid development of new media forms the
   new media era of the digital feature such as Internet and mobile
   terminal, it continues to impact on the newspapers, periodicals,
   broadcasting, television and other traditional media. With the
   development of new technology, the new media has brought great
   convenience to people, for example, media TV on public transport, mobile
   phone APP, Internet video and so on bring the full range of influence,
   which are causing a visual change and changing the social life. By way
   of image transfer information, the visual communication in new media is
   the formation of the a new era of reading pictures, changing the
   aesthetic ability in the image art. Under the background of new media
   era, the old art has eclipsed, so artists began to pursue high-level
   information media channels, and designers seek hand-painted art with its
   unique creativity. Through the innovative mining of hand-painted art,
   this paper mainly studies the communication value and application
   significance in the new media advertising design and the purpose is to
   confirm that the hand drawn art has three aspects of cultural heritage,
   art and business in the design of new media advertising.}},

Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS}},

Abstract = {{Photogrammetry and geosciences have been closely linked since the late
   19th century due to the acquisition of high-quality 3-D data sets of the
   environment, but it has so far been restricted to a limited range of
   remote sensing specialists because of the considerable cost of metric
   systems for the acquisition and treatment of airborne imagery. Today, a
   wide range of commercial and open-source software tools enable the
   generation of 3-D and 4-D models of complex geomorphological features by
   geoscientists and other non-experts users. In addition, very recent
   rapid developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology allow for
   the flexible generation of high-quality aerial surveying and
   ortho-photography at a relatively low cost.
   The increasing computing capabilities during the last decade, together
   with the development of high-performance digital sensors and the
   important software innovations developed by computer-based vision and
   visual perception research fields, have extended the rigorous processing
   of stereoscopic image data to a 3-D point cloud generation from a series
   of non-calibrated images. Structure-from-motion (SfM) workflows are
   based upon algorithms for efficient and automatic orientation of large
   image sets without further data acquisition information, examples
   including robust feature detectors like the scale-invariant feature
   transform for 2-D imagery. Nevertheless, the importance of carrying out
   well-established fieldwork strategies, using proper camera settings,
   ground control points and ground truth for understanding the different
   sources of errors, still needs to be adapted in the common scientific
   practice.
   This review intends not only to summarise the current state of the art
   on using SfM workflows in geomorphometry but also to give an overview of
   terms and fields of application. Furthermore, this article aims to
   quantify already achieved accuracies and used scales, using different
   strategies in order to evaluate possible stagnations of current
   developments and to identify key future challenges. It is our belief
   that some lessons learned from former articles, scientific reports and
   book chapters concerning the identification of common errors or ``bad
   practices{''} and some other valuable information may help in guiding
   the future use of SfM photogrammetry in geosciences.}},

Abstract = {{Even if the rhetoric of the Internet and the new digital media seems to
   have radically changed our technological environment, historical
   recurrences are relevant tools in order to analyze the future marketing.
   We propose a new multi-stage model able to bridge two different
   approaches, namely the adoption models a la Bass and the recent line of
   research concerning agent-based innovation diffusion models. Our
   technology allows us to find a closed form equation for awareness and
   adoption, taking into account heterogeneous population.}},

Abstract = {{High resolution, 100 frames/sec intravascular optical coherence
   tomography (IVOCT) can distinguish plaque types, but further validation
   is needed, especially for automated plaque characterization. We
   developed experimental and 3D registration methods, to provide
   validation of IVOCT pullback volumes using microscopic, brightfield and
   fluorescent cryoimage volumes, with optional, exactly registered
   cryo-histology. The innovation was a method to match an IVOCT pullback
   images, acquired in the catheter reference frame, to a true 3D
   cryo-image volume. Briefly, an 11-parameter, polynomial virtual catheter
   was initialized within the cryo-image volume, and perpendicular images
   were extracted, mimicking IVOCT image acquisition. Virtual catheter
   parameters were optimized to maximize cryo and IVOCT lumen overlap.
   Local minima were possible, but when we started within reasonable
   ranges, every one of 24 digital phantom cases converged to a good
   solution with a registration error of only +1.34 +/- 2.65um (signed
   distance). Registration was applied to 10 ex-vivo cadaver coronary
   arteries (LADs), resulting in 10 registered cryo and IVOCT volumes
   yielding a total of 421 registered 2D-image pairs. Image overlays
   demonstrated high continuity between vascular and plaque features.
   Bland-Altman analysis comparing cryo and IVOCT lumen area, showed mean
   and standard deviation of differences as 0.01 +/- 0.43 mm(2). DICE
   coefficients were 0.91 +/- 0.04. Finally, visual assessment on 20
   representative cases with easily identifiable features suggested
   registration accuracy within one frame of IVOCT (+/- 200 mu m),
   eliminating significant misinterpretations introduced by 1mm errors in
   the literature. The method will provide 3D data for training of IVOCT
   plaque algorithms and can be used for validation of other intravascular
   imaging modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Digital tomosynthesis system (DTS), which scans an object in a limited
   angle, has been considered as an innovative imaging modality which can
   present lower patient dose than computed tomography and solve the
   problem of poor depth resolution in conventional digital radiography.
   Although it has many powerful advantages, only breast tomosynthesis
   system has been adopted in many hospitals. In order to reduce the
   patient dose while maintaining image quality, the acquisition conditions
   need to be studied. In this study, we analyzed effective dose and image
   qualities of chest phantom using commercialized universal chest digital
   tomosynthesis (CDT) R/F system to study the optimized exposure
   parameters. We set 10 different acquisition conditions including the
   default acquisition condition by user manual of Shimadzu (100 kVp with
   0.5 mAs). The effective dose was calculated from PCXMC software version
   1.5.1 by utilizing the total X-ray exposure measured by ion chamber. The
   image quality was evaluated by signal difference to noise ratio (SDNR)
   in the regions of interest (ROIs) pulmonary arteries at different axial
   in-plane. We analyzed a figure of merit (FOM) which considers both the
   effective dose and the SDNR in order to determine the optimal
   acquisition condition. The results indicated that the most suitable
   acquisition parameters among 10 conditions were condition 7 and 8 (120
   kVp with 0.04 mAs and 0.1 mAs, respectively), which indicated lower
   effective dose while maintaining reasonable SDNRs and FOMs for three
   specified regions. Further studies are needed to be conducted for
   detailed outcomes in CDT acquisition conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Mining companies are shifting their strategies and adopting new business
   and operating models to include new technologies and are doing so on a
   more rapid and global basis than ever before. A combination of market
   volatility, changing global demand, radically different input economics,
   new locations in search of more reserves, a focus on a longer asset
   lifecycle and a commitment to operational excellence as well as policy
   shifts around the globe are all contributing to a seismic shift in the
   industry.
   Decades of cost reduction and the aging workforce have left mining
   companies with limited resources to adjust. Now, a rapidly evolving set
   of new technologies - the Digital Transformation - open new
   possibilities to improve operating efficiency, develop more accurate and
   agile planning, heighten vendor awareness and collaborate with business
   partners throughout the value chain. The mining industry is at the
   epicenter of this digital transformation, which is very real and can
   drive considerable differentiation and competitive advantage within the
   industry. Automation of the mines, new analytic capabilities, digital
   workers, remote and autonomous operation are just some of the examples
   where the technologies are disrupting the mining industry today. All of
   these need to be looked at very closely to drive growth and increase
   efficiencies.
   It is critical for mining companies to understand the digital
   transformation and its associated opportunities and risks. A more
   interconnected and information based operation will continue to push the
   envelope of what needs human interaction. The possibilities for new
   operating models and new levels of optimization will create the next
   wave of differentiation in the industry. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Students of Moscow schools and other educational institutions between
   the ages of 16 and 18 years old were surveyed to assess how Russian
   schools use modern methods of e-learning, mobile technologies, and
   social media in the learning process. The sample covered 3,194
   respondents. The study describes three waves of Russian school
   informatization and the challenges the system has been facing over the
   last five years: the extensive use of mobile phones and PDAs with
   high-speed access to the Internet by students and the active use of
   social media services for communication, search, and the storage of
   information. The article demonstrates the obvious progress of the
   schooling system: present-day teachers communicate with their students
   via email and social networks and occasionally give homework assignments
   to be done online or using Internet services. Yet, the school remains an
   extremely conservative institution. The education system is insensitive
   to the rapid development of technologies, and the process of
   modernization is essentially inhibited by sticking to conventional
   teaching practices and ignoring innovative ones.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in technology are transforming the way that health data is
   collected and used. This includes improvements in existing technology as
   well as innovations in mobile technology such as smartphone apps and
   wearables. Health data is strictly regulated under the EU Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. Under current data protection rules,
   health data is broadly interpreted and will, in most circumstances not
   connected to the provision of healthcare, require organisations to
   obtain explicit consent from individuals for its collection and use.
   Further data protection compliance issues arise such as identifying who
   is a controller, ensuring transparency, using health data for research
   purposes and keeping health data secure. As the EU data protection
   landscape is due to change in the next few years and will affect the
   collection and use of health data, the forthcoming Data Protection
   Regulation also deserves attention.}},

Title = {{HYPERstream: a multi-scale framework for streamflow routing in
   large-scale hydrological model}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2047-2061}},
Abstract = {{We present HYPERstream, an innovative stream-flow routing scheme based
   on the width function instantaneous unit hydrograph (WFIUH) theory,
   which is specifically designed to facilitate coupling with weather
   forecasting and climate models. The proposed routing scheme preserves
   geomorphological dispersion of the river network when dealing with
   horizontal hydrological fluxes, irrespective of the computational grid
   size inherited from the overlaying climate model providing the
   meteorological forcing. This is achieved by simulating routing within
   the river network through suitable transfer functions obtained by
   applying the WFIUH theory to the desired level of detail. The underlying
   principle is similar to the block-effective dispersion employed in
   ground-water hydrology, with the transfer functions used to represent
   the effect on streamflow of morphological heterogeneity at scales
   smaller than the computational grid. Transfer functions are constructed
   for each grid cell with respect to the nodes of the network where
   streamflow is simulated, by taking advantage of the detailed
   morphological information contained in the digital elevation model (DEM)
   of the zone of interest. These characteristics make HYPERstream well
   suited for multi-scale applications, ranging from catchment up to
   continental scale, and to investigate extreme events (e.g., floods) that
   require an accurate description of routing through the river network.
   The routing scheme enjoys parsimony in the adopted parametrization and
   computational efficiency, leading to a dramatic reduction of the
   computational effort with respect to full-gridded models at comparable
   level of accuracy. HYPERstream is designed with a simple and flexible
   modular structure that allows for the selection of any rainfall-runoff
   model to be coupled with the routing scheme and the choice of different
   hillslope processes to be represented, and it makes the framework
   particularly suitable to massive parallelization, customization
   according to the specific user needs and preferences, and continuous
   development and improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Human civilization can be ameliorated by human creativity. Innovation
   and progress of human civilization result from a change in our thinking
   patterns, thus, potentially transforming the present into a creative
   future. Accentuating the role of creativity in design even more than
   other disciplines pushes one to underpin the understanding of creativity
   as a key role player in architecture. Furthermore, by identifying the
   basic principles of our ingenuity/creativity, researchers might be able
   to enhance this ability in the future. The digital era allows for a new
   domain of architectural experience. It is assumed that new designs in
   virtual environments can be created that go beyond the mere
   accommodation of literal functions, and affect human experiences. This
   paper presents the role of a method developed by the authors:
   `Proto-Fuse', experimented with, as an artwork for the survey of
   cognitive perception of humans, specifically targeting enhancement of
   spatial creativity. The logic behind this method is based on two
   psychological concepts: 1 - conceptual blending, 2 - tolerance of
   ambiguity. Two experimental projects were conducted for exploring the
   Proto Fuse method: (a) ``unconventional virtual environments (UVEs){''}
   to improve conceptual blending and (b) ``Extracting local distance{''}
   to enhance tolerance of ambiguity.
   The paper concludes with an implementation scenario of the Proto-Fuse
   method in the pedagogy of architecture and elaborates on the results of
   the projects and analysis of the feedbacks received during the project
   session.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a wrapped statistics-based approach for phase estimation from
   noisy reconstructed interference fringes in digital holographic
   interferometry. The state space model required here is formed by Taylor
   series expansion of the phase function as state model and the wrapped
   dynamical system as measurement model. Prediction of the state using
   Kalman filter is straightforward since the state model is linear.
   However, the non-linearity issue induced due to the wrapping of the
   measurements is handled by changing the innovation correction step,
   which accounts for the probability of wrappings. Through the simulation
   and experimental study, we have shown that the proposed approach is
   robust to both, noise in fringe pattern as well as the dynamic range of
   the phase pattern, simultaneously. Moreover, it outperforms when
   compared with the other state-of-the-art phase retrieval approaches.}},

Abstract = {{How have book marketing, publicity, and retailing changed with the
   dominance of the internet? Clearly, e-commerce has altered who the major
   players are: battles between market-dominating Amazon and its various
   retail and publishing adversaries are well documented. But, more
   pervasively, how has the rise of the digital literary sphere changed the
   whole manner in which books are `sold' to potential readers, not only in
   the sense of a commercial transaction, but in the broader sense of
   `selling' readers on the idea of bookishness? Examining innovations in
   digital book marketing such as book trailers and blog tours, this
   article explores how the digital literary sphere is transforming notions
   of contemporary book community. It probes whether existing theories and
   methods for studying the contemporary literary ecosystem are adequate to
   account for these new realities.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of digital technologies offers a great potential for the
   creativity and innovation in all aspects of tourism industry. The
   integration between advanced technologies of ICT and tourism industry
   plays vital role in enhancing the tourism services and experiences,
   particularly, in the context of archaeological tourism. Following this,
   this study proposes a protocol that offers tourists site/destination and
   experiences according to their preferences. More specifically, tourists
   can express various preferences regarding the type of tourism site,
   their contention level in order to avoid crowded ones, the accessibility
   and convenience of different sections of a site, and the distance and
   congestion of the paths lead to such site. etc. Our Contention,
   Convenience and Accessibility based Smart Tourism-destination Approach
   (CASTA) is presented in this paper to offer online services for tourists
   assuming that they are always connected and they do not have advanced IT
   skills. A tourist has only to send a preference message that specifies
   all the personal constraints via a smart hand held device. A control
   unit that resides on the cloud analyzes the message and suggests a tour
   to certain sites and their sections based on the tourist preferences.
   Information about tourism sites and their sections, in terms of
   contention, convenience, and accessibility, is collected by wireless
   sensor networks and sent to the control unit via a gateway node. Results
   of simulated experiments of CASTA have shown that it outperforms the
   shortest path approach which suggests a tour based solely on the
   distance toward those tourism destinations. Moreover CASTA
   outperformance shortest path approach that takes the quality of network
   connections available over the selected paths.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of a transport system is dependent on how resources in
   the system are utilized. The freight transport sector in Sweden is
   fragmented, composed predominantly of small operators affiliated with
   intermediary companies that handle sales and contact with customers. In
   addition, the majority of innovations in freight transport have been
   technical in nature, such as advancements in engines, fuel type and
   information technology. Organizational developments leading to changed
   behavior remain lacking. The aim of this paper is to further develop the
   procurement process with route optimization to improve overall
   efficiency in a transport system. An unconditional requirement is
   digital information at all stages in the supply chain. In a case study,
   a commercial vehicle routing software was used to create a situation
   analysis of a manually dispatched transport network to 324 retail
   outlets, which was subsequently compared to the route-optimized
   solution. Next, the case study was related to a new transport service
   purchasing model, the ``Five-step model{''}. The five steps are
   outlined, beginning with situation analysis followed by the simulation
   of new routes; the procurement process, including defining
   specifications and selecting a provider; open book pricing with joint
   review of routes; negotiations and contractor agreement; and, finally,
   payment with reverse billing. In the Five-step model, stakeholders
   negotiate in terms of distance, time, and sequenced routes, rather than
   a single price per stop, which is customary in the transport industry in
   Sweden. Implicitly, the relationship between parties changes, with
   greater transparency and ultimately a shift in power in the supply chain
   from the transport company to the transport buyer. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Nationals Spain policies 1:1 were specified in most of Spain's
   territories through the ``School 2.0{''} program, but in the case of the
   Community of Madrid, the national policy was defined through the
   ``Technological Innovation Schools{''} program. This latter program
   aimed to introduce changes on the use of ICT in the Secondary Schools
   which joined the project, in order to increase the educational success
   of students, understood as improving academic outcomes. Both programs
   differ in the kind of technological equipment provided to the centers
   and in the grades targeted. Unlike the ``School 2.0{''} program, which
   provided laptops to the schools, in Madrid fixed terminals fastened to
   the floor were chosen, which depended on multiple servers per classroom.
   On the other hand, rather than focus in 5th and 6th grade, it was
   implemented in 1st and 2nd grade of Secondary Education. In this study,
   the Secondary Education teachers' opinions and expectations about the
   impact of this policy in their teaching practices (students grouping,
   use of digital learning materials and students' digital competences) are
   described.}},

Abstract = {{The distance learning with the use of Information Technologies and
   Communications (ITC), it is a need for the initial and continuous
   formation of professionals. It has been subject to discussion whether
   the professionals and pupils have an adequate preparation to confront
   this challenge or not. This generates a contradiction between the
   didactic principles of distance learning with the use of ITC for the
   professional's formation. There are checked the elements that contribute
   to consider the teaching formation like an articulation of factors that
   enable the appropriation of the resources of the digital technology for
   teaching. The situation referred led to the objective: analyzing the
   theoretical elements related to the conceptual and practical studies on
   distance education using ICT in the formation of professionals. The
   results showed that pedagogical quality and teacher preparation with the
   use of ICT improve the teaching-learning process, favoring also
   innovative programs in educational fields.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor technologies are crucial in ambient assisted living system
   because they can observe, measure, and detect users' daily activities,
   in the meanwhile issue warnings when parameters exceed particular
   thresholds. Despite their enormous supporting potential, the quantities
   of data generated from multiple sensor is huge (i.e., big data), because
   they involved everywhere, such as smart home, health-based wearable
   devices, and assistive robots. Generally speaking, big data can be
   defined as large pools of data which comes from digital pictures,
   videos, intelligent sensors, posts to social media sites, purchase
   transaction records, cell phone global positioning system signals, to
   name a few. During the past few years, there is a great interest both in
   the commercial and in the research communities around big data. Under
   these circumstances, data mining, whose main purpose is to extract value
   from mountains of datasets, is drawing a lot of people's attention. To
   follow this trend, in this article, we intend to take an algorithmic
   point of view, i.e., applying intelligent algorithms to data, with an
   emphasis on the biology-based innovative computational intelligence (CI)
   methods. This work makes several contributions. First, it investigates a
   set of biology-based innovative CI algorithms which can enable a high
   throughput under extract from the insights of data. Second, it
   summarizes the core working principles of these algorithms
   systematically and highlights their preliminary applications in
   different areas of data mining. This will allow us to clearly pinpoint
   the intrinsic strengths of these novel algorithms, and also to define
   the potential further research directions. The findings of this chapter
   should provide useful insights into the current big data literature and
   be a good source for anyone who is interested in the application of CI
   approaches to big data and its corresponding fields.}},

Abstract = {{Today, accurate and low complexity modelling of secondary parameters of
   twisted copper pairs at high frequencies is necessary, especially for
   modern transmission systems. The newly presented G.fast subscriber
   technology can occupy frequencies up to 212 MHz. For the purpose of its
   performance evaluations as well as for quick and accurate estimations of
   its transmission channel, the possibilities for accurate twisted pair's
   parameters approximation should be investigated. Basically, the
   motivation presented within this paper is to propose a completely new
   model for estimations of a propagation constant and its temperature
   dependence of twisted pairs and metallic cables suitable for G.fast
   frequencies. The main idea of a presented model is the innovative
   adoption of an inverse hyperbolic sine function in order to provide more
   accurate approximation of a propagation constant. (f) and its
   temperature character. The accuracy of a proposed model was verified for
   various metallic cables with different constructional arrangement and
   parameters. Based on the comparison of our proposed model with other
   typical existing models, the presented model outperforms the accuracy of
   all existing models using equal number of necessary parameters.}},

Title = {{Adoption readiness in service innovation: the case of digital money}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{353-381}},
Abstract = {{One challenge for firms seeking to develop new services is to understand
   the conditions likely to affect the rates of adoption. Understanding
   relative degrees of `adoption readiness' provides innovators with
   information to choose market segments and indicates opportunities to
   influence adoption environments. However, there is a little research
   into the adoption readiness of countries upon which firms can base their
   new service development decisions. This paper considers these issues
   through the case of digital money, a service innovation some claim to
   have the potential to provide major economic and social benefits.
   Defined as `currency exchange by electronic means', we conceptualise
   digital money as a socio-technical system, and propose a Digital Money
   Readiness Index. This composite index integrates institutional,
   financial, technological, economic, industrial and social attributes to
   measure adoption readiness. We identify four stages of readiness and
   systematically analyse the factors that drive under or over adoption of
   digital money technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Digital storytelling is a narrative technique with a great educational
   potential, as it adopts creative formula, which integrates multi-format
   information to communicate ideas, using a technological support. This
   research shows the level of communicative, narrative and digital
   competence linked to the creation of digital storytelling in digital
   environments, reached by students of the Degree of Primary School
   Teacher (N=143). With this purpose, a rubric composed of 28 indicators
   was used, 12 indicators referred to the communicative competence
   (written and oral communication), 6 to the narrative and 10 to the
   digital. The results demonstrate that most students have a great ability
   using the computer application, whilst almost a third shows a medium-low
   level of communicative competence. Some difficulties were detected in
   screenplay creation and its adaptation to the linguistic register
   previously chosen -poor vocabulary and inaccurate punctuation-, as well
   as pronunciation's defects when saying the dialogues, as some of them
   were not able to transmit expressiveness to the story. Regarding
   narrative competence, only a 40\% are original in resolving the plot and
   creating characters. Certainly, this kind of experiences provides a
   motivating scene to develop narrative and creative skills in digital
   environments and offers numerous opportunities for future teachers'
   training.}},

   carried out by followers of A Song of Ice and Fire series in the web Los

   textual content in order to modify and expand the ludic and aesthetics
   experience related to literary works: the receiver becomes co-creator of
   the work. This highlights the importance of affinity spaces in the
   process of receiving, because it promotes interaction that goes far
   beyond the understanding and interpretation of the original text. From
   this perspective, a review of creative practices in this communicative
   scenario to conclude that these have extraordinary learning potential
   through which we can come up with innovative proposals in the field of

Abstract = {{Technology-based learning modules are mostly challenged by their
   acceptance. A single-case study and mixed research method are used to
   explore a unique situation of applying digital lectures at the
   postgraduate Programmes at the Faculty of Tourism at Damascus University
   as a solution for brain drain in the Syrian higher education system.
   Results indicate that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy (EE),
   Personal Innovativeness and Satisfaction with the Quality of Services
   have a significant effect on students' Behavioural Intention to accept
   digital lectures. This effect was stronger for males. However, EE was a
   better predictor for students under 30. In addition, students regarded
   the use of digital lectures as an alternative plan to continuing their
   postgraduate studies abroad within the current restrictions on Syrians.
   For the future successful implementation of e-learning modules,
   infrastructure-related issues should be taken into account. The study
   recommends universities going through brain drain and similar crisis
   situations to utilise digital lectures.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology, all walks in the
   society begin to use the computer science and technology to improve
   their work efficiency, and in the cloud computing environment, service
   model of libraries in colleges and universities have also been changed.
   Not only services of libraries in colleges and universities have been
   updated and changed, but also the efficiency of utilizing resources in
   libraries in colleges and library users' degree of satisfaction have
   been improved. Based on this, this paper studies and analyzes the
   development of service model in libraries of colleges and universities
   in cloud computing environment.
   With the emergence and development of computer network and cloud
   computing, traditional service model of libraries has been shocked and
   begin to transform into complex and digital libraries. Such evolution
   results from development of the network. At the current stage, cloud
   computing has brought major innovation to the development of libraries,
   so people begin to pay attention to cloud computing and new service
   model of libraries in cloud computing environment.}},

Abstract = {{It has been argued that the use of digital technologies within higher
   education is now `natural'; that devices and networks which might `once
   might have appeared exotic or transformative are now considered
   mainstream'. Whilst students in higher education might endorse these
   expectations that some form of technology will feature in their study,
   it is vital that this is predicated on a considered, relevant and
   supported approach to using technology in learning and teaching which is
   integral to academic practice and aligned with professional values. But
   in a climate where a prevalent discourse of innovation dominates, how do
   we know if we have got the basics right? This paper reflects on
   initiatives within two arts institutions aimed toward developing staff
   digital confidence. Key to these initiatives is the issue of engaging
   practitioners with the importance of sound pedagogical design whilst
   developing familiarity with appropriate forms of technology.}},

Abstract = {{The CREDO Digital Document Repository enables short- and long-term
   archiving of large volumes of digital resources, ensuring bitstream
   preservation and providing most of the technical means to ensure content
   preservation of digital resources. The goal of the paper is to describe
   the design and implementation an innovative component of the CREDO
   Repository: the Persistence Management Subsystem (PMS). This subsystem
   sets guidelines for the file management system on replicas placement,
   and data relocation. The module responsible for scheduling access to the
   archive provides energy efficiency by setting suboptimal schedules. The
   module responsible for diagnose and exchange of data carriers calculates
   the probabilities of failure, and the information is used by the
   scheduling module to select appropriate storage areas for reading or
   writing of data, and for marking the areas as obsolete. Finally, the
   power management module is responsible for starting-up the storage areas
   only when necessary.}},

   materials for students. The evaluation methodology was derived from the
   Self-Regulated Learning Theory which relates to cognitive,
   meta-cognitive, motivational and self-efficacy aspects of learning. Data
   were collected by administrating the Lab Feedback Questionnaire, the
   Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), the Computer
   System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ), and interviews held with students
   and teachers. The findings that were obtained over two years taught us
   that one of the most important factors affecting the success of an
   advanced technological learning platform is the careful design of
   students' assignments, for example, to progress gradually from solving
   basic exercises, to solving more significant problems and dealing with

   technologies used to support specific learning goals and objectives.
   This shift in emphasis has had consequences that have yet to be properly
   addressed. For example, the prior emphasis in the instructional design
   community on evaluation and empirical research has declined while there
   has been increasing emphasis on innovation and specific technologies.
   Doctoral programs in instructional design have also experienced a shift
   in emphasis from research and scholarship to development and practice.
   Overall, instructional design is becoming more and more a craft industry
   and less and less a scientific enterprise. These generalizations might
   be overstated but they raise concerns with regard to how best to link
   together the design of instruction, educational research, and the
   deployment of technologies aimed at improving learning, performance, and
   instruction. This chapter presents an elaboration of these claims and a
   possible path to resolution that builds on emphasizing formative
   evaluation and fidelity of implementation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in the field of ICT and the facilities offered by the digital
   wave have favoured the renewal of some innovative methods like the
   flipped classroom (FC). This method which is based on instructional
   media devotes class time to active learning. As a learner-centred
   method, it requires that the teacher move from the role of a knowledge
   transmitter to that of a mentor and guide focused on continuous
   assessment of the learning process. Despite its purported benefits, FC
   may be perceived positively or negatively by learners who are familiar
   with lecture courses. This study aims to determine the factors that
   could positively or negatively impact the students' perceptions of this
   (FC) pedagogy. A quantitative exploratory study involving 80 master's
   degree students attending a semester-long course on economic
   intelligence and environmental scanning (IE and ES) showed the impact of
   the dimensions related to time, pacing, and video and social media that
   were not statistically significant. However, our study showed that the
   dimension of knowledge transferability and deeper learning has a
   positive impact on the student's perceptions of FC. This result suggests
   the adoption of the FC pedagogy in IE and ES courses.}},

Abstract = {{Over the recent years, there is a growing topicality in the business
   segment, as well as among individuals, of technologies that allow
   connecting a wide range of devices in a unified information environment,
   thereby providing automation and online monitoring of operations.
   Application of solutions ranges from transportation and logistics to
   health care, environment and rescue and safety.
   Including the devices in a single network allows achieving increased
   operational optimization, improved accuracy and efficiency; therefore,
   ensuring a business potential in virtually any market or industry.
   Although the topicality and prevalence of internet of things (IoT) are
   increasingly growing, as smart devices are seamlessly included in the
   day-to-day operations of the business environment, the benefits arising
   from the new digital technologies and online connectivity still remain
   largely underexplored in Latvia.
   Hence, the aim of the paper is to identify the main development drivers
   and the business potential of internet of things in Latvia by exploring
   the current experience and future readiness to optimize the cost base,
   develop new technologies and business models, enter new markets or
   industries, as well as to strengthen cooperation with the current and
   potential business partners by capitalizing on 24/7 connectivity of a
   range of devices.
   To achieve the above-stated aim, in January 2016 a web-based
   questionnaire is sent out to business organizations' representatives in
   Latvia asking respondents to evaluate their current experience and
   future potential of application of internet of things solutions in their
   organization to achieve an increased efficiency or develop new
   technologies or business models.
   Research results indicate that even though the general awareness of the
   benefits that internet of things has to offer can be considered as
   relatively high, the practical application of the respective solutions
   show that the technology adoption in this field is still fairly low;
   therefore, indicating unrealized potential of internet of things usage
   in day-to-day operations.
   Practical implications of research results are mainly based on the
   opportunity to identify gaps that prevent business customers from wider
   application of internet of things solutions and, consequently,
   benefiting from opportunities in technological and efficiency
   advancement.}},

Abstract = {{The content of this paper refers to the global trend of digitalization
   and its implications on decision making. Digitalization is currently the
   key driver for change in business and organizations. Affected is
   everything, from market structures to customer behaviour over supply
   chain and production itself. Internal processes have opportunities for a
   new design, production and logistics. Therefore digitalization will
   influence every work place and create new challenges for the entire
   organization. This massive game changing opportunity has to be steered
   by management and hence management decisions are a must while this
   transition phase; furthermore decisions will influence this transition
   but decisions itself are also affected. In the first part of the paper,
   typical decision models will be discussed; a rational model with first
   ideas of the neoclassical economists (e.g. Adam Smith or Max Weber) and
   scientific approaches of Pascal and de Fermat or Bernoulli, mainly
   focused on agents which maximize their utility. Further developed by von
   Neumann/Morgenstern economic decisions seem to be a strong rational and
   mathematical process to find utility maximization. This rational model
   is illustrated on the one hand to explain the traditional way and have a
   view on the model of homo oeconomicus. On the other hand, a new view on
   decision making was completely described by an emotional model from
   Kahneman/Tversky, which shows an emotional aspect of decisions, because
   humans don't follow strict rational rules. Especially in organizations a
   mixed view of both ideal models are still vital, as explained from
   March/Simon, continued in Simon's bounded reality. In the second part of
   the paper, digitalization as one part of globalization will be
   explained. Digitalization will change completely the business
   environment and the setup of organizations. New market structures,
   customer behaviour and processes will change the entire operations of
   business and organizations. Then the main discussion of the paper, the
   impacts of digitalization on decision making will show the trend toward
   the well known model of homo oeconomicus, which is a common model in
   economics; but known with a lot of limitations. Automatization of
   processes will affect the decision process in organization and
   consequently an adoption of business models seems obvious. This new
   decision making processes will be mainly automated in the future, hence
   an algorithm logic is required and enables the model of homo oeconomicus
   a revivial, driven by machines.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This article reviews the four challenges that the
   traditional press has inherited to its digital counterpart: introduce
   multimedia information narratives to attract new readers, generate
   proximity strategies for users, develop new business models, and become
   a professional space that reflects the feminisation of journalism
   studies. Method: This article presents the results of a content analysis
   applied to 281 news media companies founded by entrepreneurial
   journalists. Results and conclusions: The results of this study show
   that entrepreneurial journalism has not innovated in the presentation of
   information (it uses fixed images as the main attraction).
   Entrepreneurial news media have adopted the same advertising-based
   business model of the traditional press and lack channels to receive
   feedback from users. Finally, like their printed counterparts, digital
   news media are not yet a space for female empowerment.}},

Abstract = {{We currently have numerous applications related to Web 2.0 and they
   offer in education new spaces for communication and collaboration as
   well as to create communities of shared knowledge and learning networks.
   This paper presents an innovative experience developed at the University
   Pablo de Olavide of Seville with 2.0 digital technology and is performed
   within the research entitled: ``Teaching innovation 2.0 with Technology
   and Communication in the European Higher Education Area{''}, within the
   framework of Action 2 of Innovation and Educational Development Projects
   funded by the Vice-Chancelor for Teaching and European convergence from
   the mentioned university. The experience has been developed with the
   students of the subjects of Education and Health Promotion, Faculty of
   Social Sciences. The study began in the 2008/2009 academic year and
   developed courses in the other post until now, coming to participate in
   the academic year 2013/2014, 60 students of the Grade in Social
   Education. Among the educational goals of the experience we want to
   emphasize: promoting the leading role of the university student as a
   catalyst and facilitator of knowledge, use of blogs as a teaching
   resource as well as develop a space for reflection on various topics
   treated in the subject. In conclusion the study it was found that blogs
   are easy to make and use, have favored the active role of students plus
   they are an important resource for the training of students and an
   educational tool to disseminate knowledge and educational experiences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents public media's national-local model for providing
   high-quality educational transmedia to America's children as part of the
   US Department of Education's Ready to Learn (RTL) program. Using
   connected, multiplatform content as an innovative way to help narrow the
   academic achievement gap for underserved children, the Corporation for
   Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and local
   public media stations coordinated efforts to overcome access issues and
   better reach children from low-income families. This required strong
   local partnerships and new approaches to implementing content in diverse
   learning settings. Topics explored in this paper include: (1) RTL's
   mission to serve all children, (2) narrowing the achievement gap through
   transmedia, (3) highlights of new PBS KIDS math content funded by RTL,
   (4) making digital content accessible to low-income families, (5) public
   media's national-local service model, and (6) community engagement
   examples from Ohio and Washington.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing technologies are often developed incrementally, and less
   attention has been directed at radical innovations. Radical
   manufacturing technology innovations pursue significant performance
   improvements in the production process and are expected to enhance the
   competitiveness of the firm. This paper explores the successful creation
   of radical manufacturing technology innovations by analyzing previous
   empirical research and characterizing the emergence and management of
   the innovations. Companies engage in radical manufacturing technology
   innovations by bringing in advanced manufacturing technologies, carrying
   out technology-related R\&D in processes, and innovation in their supply
   chain processes. Innovation by adopting new technologies developed
   elsewhere appears as more dominant than innovation by creation.
   Forthcoming research is proposed on different management practices for
   different types and contexts of manufacturing technology innovations,
   and on how digitalization-related innovations can be made into a source
   of competitive advantage.}},

   were: 1) to know from where the business ideas analyzed had emerged; 2)
   to establish whether their window of opportunity is open or closed, and
   3) to identify the profile of the entrepreneurs and mentors who had
   implemented them in order to discover their implication for the
   development of the enterprises. The research is descriptive,
   quantitative and qualitative. Among the results, the following are
   highlighted: 1) 86\% of the business ideas arose from a market need and
   not from a technological innovation; 2) 44\% of individuals believe that
   they will live of their idea in the future, and 3) only 50\% of the
   mentors have experience in the sectors in which they work.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2581}},
Pages = {{113-122}},
Abstract = {{A data collection exercise is presented that was conducted by the
   Department of Transport of the Metropolitan Assembly of Accra, Ghana, to
   further its knowledge of transportation services placed under its
   jurisdiction. In order to map the city's transportation network, a
   partnership was developed between local authorities and a Canadian
   university with the support of the French bilateral development agency.
   An innovative methodology based on the use of smartphones and digital
   technologies allowed the project team to collect and map 315 jitney
   routes in less than 2 months. Collectors equipped with GPS-enabled
   smartphones surveyed Accra's formal jitney network in its entirety and
   transmitted data daily to a team overseas in charge of mapping and
   analysis. The first map of the city's transportation network is
   presented here and preliminary conclusions are drawn from it. By mapping
   passengers' boarding and alighting, this study also offers unique
   insights into the spatial distribution of the demand for transportation
   in Accra. This research opens both methodological and operational
   perspectives. It contributes to a growing body of literature on jitneys
   and transportation planning in developing countries. It also
   demonstrates that transportation data can be collected with limited time
   and resources through the use of mobile technologies. From a practical
   point of view, these data will assist the authorities in regulating,
   planning, and developing Accra's transportation network.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new approach to calculate volume of tailing
   underwater sediments and liquid industrial wastes on the basis of
   innovative technologies. Two theodolites which are set at various points
   and a boat with a load for measuring water depth have been traditionally
   used for topographic survey of slime storage bottom. Horizontal
   directions have been simultaneously measured on the boat marker while
   using theodolites. Water depth has been determined while using a 2-kg
   circular load which was descended into brine solution with the help of
   rope. In addition to rather large time and labour costs such technology
   has required synchronization in actions on three participants involved
   in the work: operators of two theodolites and boat team in every depth
   measuring point. Methodology has been proposed for more efficient
   solution of the problem. It presupposes the use of echolocation together
   with space localization systems (GPS-systems) which can be set on a boat
   with the purpose to measure depth of a storage tank bed. An echolocation
   transducer has been installed under the boat bottom at the depth of 10
   cm from the brine solution level in the slime storage. An aerial of
   GPS-receiver has been fixed over the echo-sounder transducer. Horizontal
   positioning of bottom depth measuring points have been carried out in
   the local coordinate system. Formation of digital model for slime
   storage bottom has been executed after data input of the coordinate
   positioning that corresponded to corrected depths in the software
   package LISCAD Plus SEE. The formation has been made on the basis of a
   strict triangulation method. Creation of the digital model makes it
   rather easy to calculate a volume between a storage bottom and a
   selected level (height of filling material). In this context it is
   possible to determine a volume and an area not only above but also lower
   of the datum surface. For this purpose it is recommended to use digital
   models which are developed for various time periods of slime storage
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{In the past 30 years, China has undergone unprecedented urbanisation:
   the country's urban population surpassed that of rural areas for the
   first time in 2011. Despite its soaring popularity, the urban-rural
   divide in e-commerce use has been persistent and striking. How to
   promote e-commerce use among the new urbanites to ensure its sustainable
   development and reduce the digital divide in China's rapid urbanisation
   context? Drawing on the diffusion of innovations theory and the Theory
   of Planned Behaviour, using data from a survey of a representative
   sample of China's urban population (N = 1288), this study investigates
   the various effects of normative social influence on online shopping
   application and intention among urban residents, rural-to-urban
   migrants, and in-situ urbanised rural residents. Normative social
   influence is found to be significantly associated with actual online
   shopping application, particularly among in-situ urbanised rural
   residents. The research suggests that the new urbanities in China can
   benefit from e-commerce use if strategies focusing on expanding and
   strengthening normative social influence are promoted. Policies that
   intend to address the urban-rural digital divide in information and
   communication technology adoption should also consider approaching the
   issue by utilising the normative social influence.}},

Abstract = {{Digital badges are an educational innovation used to measure learning of
   specific skills, such as information literacy. However, few studies have
   quantitatively surveyed employers for their perceptions about
   information literacy skills or digital badges. An online survey was
   developed and sent to employers to gauge perceptions of information
   literacy skills of college graduates and the use of the innovation of
   digital badges to represent competencies that students have accumulated.
   Here are the results of the survey: information literacy and
   metaliteracy skills are valued in the workplace; employers would like
   more detailed representations of student skills; and digital badges are
   a possible way to showcase student achievement.}},

Title = {{Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction between the human
   and the nonhuman}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL CREATIVITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{52-70}},
Abstract = {{This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an
   uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human-machine interaction as a
   milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable
   of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the
   uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to
   trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories
   of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and
   aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute
   playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a
   practical-theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital
   innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and
   affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the
   human and the nonhuman. Using a research through making' approach, the
   article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and
   prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an
   open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an
   investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated
   uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital
   interaction, and to engender creative human-nonhuman relationships
   within a given digital milieu.}},

   range of services that offer real-life environments for teaching and
   training cybersecurity and digital forensics. The cloud-based
   infrastructure, the virtualized environment and the developed
   educational tool enable the construction of a dynamic e-learning
   environment making the training very close to reality and to real-life
   situations. The paper presents the Dynamic Forensic Digital tool named
   EduFors and describes the different levels of college and university
   education where the tool is introduced and used in the training of

Abstract = {{Analog and digital electronic subjects are part of the electronic
   engineer degree but its taught is not easy because they are founded in
   opposite methodologies. The electronic design in the digital field is
   centered in the use of microprocessor and FPGA based circuits using high
   level programing/configuring languages. The counterpart analog design is
   traditionally based in the use of elementary components associated with
   macroblocks such operational amplifiers in order to built-up the wanted
   mission circuit. Some few components, as the FPAA, are analogically
   configurable in a similar manner already used with the FPGA. However the
   use of this kind of components is not straightforward once is necessary
   acquire some concepts not taught in the traditionally analog electronic
   classes.

Abstract = {{Electronic teaching is a task that intents to also prepare the student
   to understand and design analog and digital circuits. However the design
   flow in those two arenas are quite opposite as result of very different
   development state and also are the design methodologies, being
   challenging for both teachers and students. In fact, the electronic
   design in the digital field is centered in the use of components based
   in two kind of circuits (microprocessor and FPGA) using a relatively
   high level programing/configuring languages. In an opposite way, the
   analog design is traditionally founded in the use of elementary
   components (e.g. resistors and capacitors) associated with macroblocks
   (e.g. operational amplifiers) in order to built-up the wanted mission
   circuit. However they have just a few analog programmable components, as
   the PSoC that is analogically configurable in a similar manner that the
   one already used in the digital domain. The use of this kind of
   components, however, is not straightforward being necessary to get some
   concepts traditionally not taught in the analog electronic classes. The
   training using PSoC are then indispensable to verify if the programed
   analog circuit corresponds to the intended one.
   The current work present an innovative remote lab to support teaching of
   the PSoC.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative technologies for digital imaging and telecommunications are
   changing the way we deliver health care. Telepathology collaborations
   are one example of how delivering remote pathology services to patients
   can benefit from leveraging this change. Over the years, several
   academic and commercial teleconsultation networks have been established.
   Herein, we review the landscape of these international telepathology
   efforts and highlight key supportive factors and potential barriers to
   successful cross-border collaborations. Important features of successful
   international telepathology programs include efficient workflows,
   dedicated information technology staff, continuous maintenance,
   financial incentives, ensuring that all involved stakeholders are
   satisfied, and value-added clinical benefit to patient care. Factors
   that plague such telepathology operations include legal/regulatory
   issues, sustainability, and cultural and environmental issues.
   Pathologists, vendors and laboratory accreditation agencies will need to
   embrace and capitalize on this new paradigm of international
   telepathology accordingly. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Two normal faults on the island of Crete and mainland Greece were
   studied to test an innovative workflow with the goal of obtaining a more
   objective palaeoseismic trench log, and a 3-D view of the sedimentary
   architecture within the trench walls. Sedimentary feature geometries in
   palaeoseismic trenches are related to palaeoearthquake magnitudes which
   are used in seismic hazard assessments. If the geometry of these
   sedimentary features can be more representatively measured, seismic
   hazard assessments can be improved. In this study more representative
   measurements of sedimentary features are achieved by combining classical
   palaeoseismic trenching techniques with multispectral approaches. A
   conventional trench log was firstly compared to results of ISO
   (iterative self-organising) cluster analysis of a true colour
   photomosaic representing the spectrum of visible light. Photomosaic
   acquisition disadvantages (e.g. illumination) were addressed by
   complementing the data set with active near-infrared backscatter signal
   image from t-LiDAR measurements. The multispectral analysis shows that
   distinct layers can be identified and it compares well with the
   conventional trench log. According to this, a distinction of adjacent
   stratigraphic units was enabled by their particular multispectral
   composition signature. Based on the trench log, a 3-D interpretation of
   attached 2-D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles collected on the
   vertical trench wall was then possible. This is highly beneficial for
   measuring representative layer thicknesses, displacements, and
   geometries at depth within the trench wall. Thus, misinterpretation due
   to cutting effects is minimised. This manuscript combines
   multiparametric approaches and shows (i) how a 3-D visualisation of
   palaeoseismic trench stratigraphy and logging can be accomplished by
   combining t-LiDAR and GPR techniques, and (ii) how a multispectral
   digital analysis can offer additional advantages to interpret
   palaeoseismic and stratigraphic data. The multispectral data sets are
   stored allowing unbiased input for future (re)investigations.}},

Abstract = {{This article adds to the empirical evidence on the impact of
   agglomeration externalities on regional growth along three main
   dimensions. On the basis of data on 259 Europe NUTS2 (Nomenclature of
   Territorial Units for Statistics) regions and 15 NACE (Nomenclature
   statistique des Activites economiques dans la Communaute Europeenne) 1.1
   2-digit industries for the period 1990-2007, we show that agglomeration
   externalities are stronger in technology-intensive industries, also
   after controlling for sorting; that specialization externalities are
   stronger for low density regions, while diversity matters more for
   denser urban areas; and, finally, that Jacobs externalities comprise a
   pure diversification effect (related variety) and a portfolio effect
   (unrelated variety), although evidence of positive effects on regional
   growth is only found for the latter. An additional contribution of this
   article is to extend the analysis on the basis of a full geographical
   coverage of European NUTS2 regions, with the aim to generalize the
   empirical identification of the impacts of specialization and
   diversification externalities with respect to the existing literature.
   Our results are robust to a rich set of consistency checks, including
   the use of spatial autoregressive models with autoregressive
   disturbances, used to assess to what extent the effects of agglomeration
   externalities are localized.}},

Title = {{Managing adaptive orientation systems for museum visitors from an IoT
   perspective}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{285-304}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Starting from the premises that Internet of Things (IoT)
   applications can be used in museums as an aid to visiting systems, the
   purpose of this paper is to see how recommendation systems can be
   developed to provide advanced services to museum visitors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology employs a
   qualitative exploratory multi-case study: the method used has consisted
   in crossing the information currently known on the most advanced
   communication technologies (ICT) with the requirements of enhancing
   museum services, in order to determine the possible trajectories of
   applying the former to the latter.
   Findings - The implementation of recommender system outlines the main
   implications and effects of an advanced market-driven digital
   orientation, as the system's users are the starting point for innovation
   and the creation of value. For a museum, it will be possible to access
   to an additional system of knowledge alongside that of its scientific
   staff. This process has profound implications in the way in which a
   museum presents itself and how it is perceived by its visitors and, in a
   wider sense, by the potential demand.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper consists in an exploratory
   effort to introduce an analytical framework for an evolved adaptive
   museum orientation system; the empirical investigation can be structured
   in the inductive-predictive view of assessing this promising debate
   further.
   Originality/value - Implementing the IoT blueprint entails introducing a
   plethora of new products, services and business models, opening new
   routes to guide and direct cultural events. Now, more than ever,
   sustainable development involves an intrinsic balancing act between the
   pluralism of data and that of customer needs, which is achieved through
   the elaboration of digital data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - An empirical testing on IBM smart cities projects was applied
   so as to demonstrate that the combination between the use of Internet of
   Things (IoT) and the implementation of the Open Innovation (OI) model
   within smart cities which has been changed the development of urban
   areas and effected firms' innovativeness. The paper aims to discuss
   these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology on a leading
   multinational firms deeply involved in smart cities projects has been
   chosen.
   Findings - From this study it emerged how IBM: has a clear vision of
   smart cities and IoT; adopt a worldwide OI approach to smart cities;
   delineate-specific strategies and create OI units ad hoc for smart
   cities' projects.
   Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this work is
   that the analysis presented has been developed only on one case of
   multinational firm that operate in smart cities contexts.
   Practical implications - Recommendations will be made both to public and
   private actor in order to plan and implement efficient strategies to
   improve their performances.
   Originality/value - The concept of smart city has become quite popular
   between scholars and practitioners in the era of digital economy. Cities
   become smart developing new urban area using new Information and
   Communication Technologies such as mobile devices, the semantic web,
   cloud computing, and the IoT. Smart cities make innovation ecosystem,
   joining together different forces like knowledge-intensive activities,
   institutions for cooperation and learning, and web-based applications
   collective intelligence. This research is of importance and significance
   to scholars, government, and firms who need to understand the relevance
   of smart cities in the current economy.}},

Title = {{Network-based innovation: the case for mobile gaming and digital music}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{155-175}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to identify, analyze and discuss a potential
   new business opportunity that arises from the intersection of the
   digital music and game industries across borders throughout
   network-based innovation approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research draws on review of industry
   and academic literature, two online surveys and interviews, overall
   encompassed by a interpretative exploratory research methodology
   strategy.
   Findings - The study supports the interest and potential for developing
   new products that combine digital music and casual digital games and
   that draw on firms from more than one region, while potentially
   involving a wide set of social network key stakeholders.
   Research limitations/implications - This is an exploratory study in
   which findings should be challenged by confirmatory studies, including
   new product design and development of modeling techniques and
   network-based innovation approaches. This research contributes for the
   generation of new insights over technological and social driving forces,
   as well as emerging trends that shed light on the global competitiveness
   and on convergence of mobile gaming and digital music industries at
   regional innovation systems view. It also discusses spillover mechanisms
   based on new knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion and knowledge
   appropriation throughout the key stakeholders. The customer-centric
   innovation and network value autocorrelation hypothesis was validated,
   and both technology convergence and social factors are enhancement
   factors for innovation. Limitations and further research with larger
   sampling, specialization techniques and empirical modeling to in-depth
   analysis is suggested.
   Practical implications - The study provides a framework for managers to
   develop new products that merges boundaries of related industries and
   encourages network-based innovation and cooperation between industry
   players, involving different regions. Ultimately, it shows opportunities
   of diversification, by introducing new products into new markets, as
   result of interdependence, soft factors, knowledge spillover and
   absorptive capacity mechanisms over a network of key stakeholders across
   different regions throughout customer-centric innovation, while
   impacting also new discussion on entrepreneurship and knowledge
   spillover theory and policy making.
   Social implications - Social capital network is key for innovation and
   knowledge spillover among industry players. Content creation regarding
   products and services show high dependence on spatial external cultural
   influences, tastes and habits for customer-centric innovation, while
   impacting on social and learning customer experience, as well.
   Originality/value - The paper has value for product development and
   innovation managers, researchers and practitioners. It discusses the
   value of innovation systems that are purposively developed beyond
   traditional geographic and industry boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To identify implementation lessons from the United Kingdom
   Delivering Assisted Living Lifestyles at Scale (dallas) program-a
   large-scale, national technology program that aims to deliver a broad
   range of digital services and products to the public to promote health
   and wellbeing.
   Materials and Methods Prospective, longitudinal qualitative research
   study investigating implementation processes. Qualitative data collected
   includes semi-structured e-Health Implementation Toolkit-led interviews
   at baseline/mid-point (n = 38), quarterly evaluation, quarterly
   technical and barrier and solutions reports, observational logs,
   quarterly evaluation alignment interviews with project leads,
   observational data collected during meetings, and ethnographic data from
   dallas events (n>200 distinct pieces of qualitative data). Data analysis
   was guided by Normalization Process Theory, a sociological theory that
   aids conceptualization of implementation issues in complex healthcare
   settings.
   Results Five key challenges were identified: 1) The challenge of
   establishing and maintaining large heterogeneous, multi-agency
   partnerships to deliver new models of healthcare; 2) The need for
   resilience in the face of barriers and set-backs including the backdrop
   of continually changing external environments; 3) The inherent tension
   between embracing innovative co-design and achieving delivery at pace
   and at scale; 4) The effects of branding and marketing issues in
   consumer healthcare settings; and 5) The challenge of interoperability
   and information governance, when commercial proprietary models are
   dominant.
   Conclusions The magnitude and ambition of the dallas program provides a
   unique opportunity to investigate the macro level implementation
   challenges faced when designing and delivering digital health and
   wellness services at scale. Flexibility, adaptability, and resilience
   are key implementation facilitators when shifting to new digitally
   enabled models of care.}},

Title = {{Exploring the integration of social media within integrated marketing
   communication frameworks Perspectives of services marketers}},
Journal = {{MARKETING INTELLIGENCE \& PLANNING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-40}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - At present no frameworks exist for services marketers to
   incorporate social media (SM) within marketing communications planning.
   The majority of integrated marketing communications (IMC) frameworks
   were developed prior to the development of the widespread use of digital
   and SM for information seeking, sales and service. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate this issue for services marketers specifically
   as they differ from FMCG, industrial and durable marketers in terms of
   marketing messages, branding, media and channels. Furthermore, as they
   are less reliant on outsourced sale channels they have more potential
   than other industries to integrate social and digital media to build
   awareness, brands and sales.
   Design/methodology/approach - Depth interviews were conducted with eight
   senior services marketing executives to identify the impact of SM on
   marketing communications planning, implementation and measurement.
   Findings - The findings revealed that the unique characteristics of SM
   (such as interactivity and individualisation, integration of
   communication and distribution channels, immediacy and information
   collection) impact traditional marketing communications frameworks.
   These impacts manifested in 12 modifications specific to services and SM
   to traditional generic IMC frameworks encompassed by the themes of
   reach, service channel, word-of-mouth advocacy, consumer generated
   messages, listening and behavioural measurement.
   Practical implications - The rapidly evolving nature of SM means senior
   services marketers need to educate organisational stakeholders regarding
   implementation issues, which may be a barrier to effective integration
   of SM within marketing communications.
   Originality/value - With digital marketing communications budgets
   reaching 30 per cent within some organisations, it is timely to put
   forward a marketing communication decision-making framework that first
   incorporates SM and second is suitable for services marketers.}},

Abstract = {{Radio over Fiber (RoF), an empowering innovation for dissemination of
   wireless broadband service signals through simple optical connections
   experiences non-linear distortion. We have designed and implemented a
   novel predistorter model to reduce nonlinear distortion using hybrid
   envelop memory polynomial (HEMPM) for the RoF system. The link gives
   satisfactory performance in the range of GHz signal. The designed
   algorithm is superior to popular approaches like memory polynomial model
   (MPM) and envelop memory polynomial model (EMPM) in terms of order of
   the memory and degree of non linearity. As per author's the best
   knowledge, this is exclusively first time result obtained for HEMPM
   technique for RoF link and also, for MPM, EMPM based predistorter for
   RoF link using MATLAB - OptiSystem co-simulation. The results shows that
   adjacent channel power (ACP) is suppressed by similar to 0.45 dB m,
   similar to 28.4 dB m and similar to 7.65 dB m of MPM \& EMPM and HEMPM
   model for K= 5 \& Q=2 whereas for K= 7 \& Q=3 the value of suppressed
   power is similar to 36.3 dB m, similar to 47.7 dB and similar to 05.8 dB
   m, respectively as compared to input signal. NMSEs for (K= 7) and memory
   length (Q=3) reduced by similar to-5.003 dB m for HEMPM model and
   increased by similar to-4.13 dB m for MPM model. The EVM is increased
   from similar to-1.56\% to similar to 1.96\% for HEMPM model and
   increased from similar to 4.38\% to similar to 14.73\% for MPM model for
   K=7 \& Q=3. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective - Measures of trends in Iowa State University library website
   visits per student/faculty/staff headcount show decreased use. Analysis
   was conducted to test for a relationship between this decrease and
   decreasing graduate/undergraduate enrollment ratios and decreasing
   visits to a popular digital collection. The purpose was to measure the
   influence of these factors and to produce an adjusted measure of trend
   which accounts for these factors.
   Methods - Website transaction log data and enrollment data were modelled
   with Box and Jenkins time series analysis methods (regression with ARMA
   errors).
   Results - A declining graduate to undergraduate enrollment ratio at Iowa
   State University explained 23\% of the innovation variance of library
   website visits per headcount over the study period, while visits to a
   popular digital collection also declined, explaining 34\% of the
   innovation variance. Rolling windows analysis showed that the effect of
   the graduate/undergraduate ratio increased over the study period, while
   the effect of digital collection visits decreased. In addition,
   estimates of website usage by graduate students and undergraduates,
   after accounting for other factors, matched estimates from a survey.
   Conclusion - A rolling windows metric of mean change adjusted for
   changes in demographics and other factors allows for a fairer comparison
   of year-to-year website usage, while also measuring the change in
   influence of these factors. Adjusting for these influences provides a
   baseline for studying the effect of interventions, such as website
   design changes. Box-Jenkins methods of analysis for time series data can
   provide a more accurate measure than ordinary regression, demonstrated
   by estimating undergraduate and graduate website usage to corroborate
   survey data. While overall website usage is decreasing, it is not clear
   it is decreasing for all groups. Inferences were made about demographic
   groups with data that is not tied to individuals, thus alleviating
   privacy concerns.}},

Abstract = {{In democratic societies, protest is a legitimate and necessary way for
   communities to seek redress for issues that are ignored by
   decision-makers. In the wake of large projects, communities often find
   they need to mobilize to achieve respect for their rights and to
   influence the decision-making processes affecting their lives. Protest
   action can take many forms (e.g. blockades, rallies, boycotts)
   constituting a repertoire of contention, which is subject to continuous
   innovation. With new information and communication technologies (ICTs),
   digital repertoires of contention are also being enacted (social media,
   online petitions, digital sit-ins, twittering). This paper integrates
   the fields of performance theory, social movements, and impact
   assessment to conceptualize social protest. We identify over 200 forms
   of protest and related terms and provide a conceptual model to
   comprehend the contemporary role of protest. We consider that protest is
   part of the broader unfolding of social dramas, and is a mechanism to
   seek redressive action in contentious situations, especially between
   impacted communities and project proponents. Companies and governments
   that respect the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)
   and meaningfully engage with local people are less likely to experience
   protest and are more successful in establishing a social licence to
   operate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations are expected to adapt within a short time to deal with
   changes that might become disruptive if not adequately dealt with. Yet
   many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the
   established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making
   and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an
   organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the
   same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive
   governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities,
   decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level
   decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may
   challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for
   governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a `balancing
   act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies. The aim of this
   editorial is to introduce the concept of adaptive governance and discuss
   its implications for governments in the digital age. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ingram Micro, the world's largest distributor of technology products,
   operates in a high-volume low-margin environment. The company started
   its Business Intelligence and Analytics practice in North America in
   2009. This group has since built and deployed a scalable, innovative
   price-optimization engine, a set of analytics applications to identify
   sales opportunities for Ingram Micro's sales force and an integrated
   digital marketing platform to run data-driven marketing campaigns for
   its customers and end-user businesses. Since 2011, these products and
   analytics programs have generated \$1.3 billion of incremental product
   revenue and \$42 million of incremental gross profit. Our next steps are
   to continue to implement these best practices in regions outside of
   North America and continue our activities that enable our sales force to
   generate revenue.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Centrifugal microfluidic platforms have significant potential in
   commercial applications because of their operational flexibility and
   minimal external infrastructure requirements. However, the dynamic and
   real-time control of fluid flow within traditional centrifugal
   microfluidic platforms is problematic. To address this significant
   limitation, we propose a two degrees of freedom platform, in which a
   digital servo is located at each end of an arm driven by a motor. This
   allows for reversible inward pumping between multiple chambers with
   perfect efficiency. Furthermore, the addition of a second degree of
   freedom allows position-based pressure controlled burst valves to be
   accessed and operated in an independent fashion. To demonstrate the
   efficacy of this technical innovation, we show rapid and configurable
   flow switching between three target chambers within a centrifugal
   microfluidic device.}},

Abstract = {{Web-based technologies have been increasingly used in picture archive
   and communication systems (PACS), in services related to storage,
   distribution, and visualization of medical images. Nowadays, many
   healthcare institutions are outsourcing their repositories to the cloud.
   However, managing communications between multiple geo-distributed
   locations is still challenging due to the complexity of dealing with
   huge volumes of data and bandwidth requirements. Moreover, standard
   methodologies still do not take full advantage of outsourced archives,
   namely because their integration with other in-house solutions is
   troublesome. In order to improve the performance of distributed medical
   imaging networks, a smart routing mechanism was developed. This includes
   an innovative cache system based on splitting and dynamic management of
   digital imaging and communications in medicine objects. The proposed
   solution was successfully deployed in a regional PACS archive. The
   results obtained proved that it is better than conventional approaches,
   as it reduces remote access latency and also the required cache storage
   space.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to undertake a critical assessment of the
   governance of Canada's national security apparatus and, more
   specifically, the growing digitization and data-driven dimensions of
   such an apparatus. Over the previous decade, since 9/11, the advent of
   electronic government (e-government) and its emphasis on horizontality
   and interoperability became intertwined with the security apparatus of
   the public sector: the recent Snowden affair in the US has once again
   brought such discussions to the forefront. It is within such a context
   that the rise of `big data' (or meta-data) as an identifiable term
   denotes a confluence of forces and contradictory tensions between
   openness and secrecy for the public sector both operationally and
   democratically. We examine Canada's Westminster insularity in this
   regard, how Canadian reforms meant to augment oversight and review
   capacities of security agencies have been stunted in recent years, and
   why such stalled actions matter to the privacy and safety of Canadian
   citizens. Conversely, a case for more openness and governance innovation
   is put forth premised on two main and inter-related directions: more
   political oversight and public dialogue on the one hand, and a greater
   emphasis on privacy as a responsibility on the other hand. Together
   these directions emphasize a more activist and participative civil
   culture that is central to ensuring societal resilience in an
   increasingly virtual and complex security environment.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Actuated by spatial universal rotating magnetic vector through digital
   control, the steering navigation of the spiral-type capsule robot in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract becomes possible. However, as a potential
   risk, the fluid resistance torsion moment generated by the rotating
   spiral-type capsule robot would distort the GI tract with insufficient
   fluid. It is difficult to investigate the fluid distorting effect on the
   GI tract, because online measurement of the fluid resistance torsion
   moment still remains unsolved. In this paper, an innovative method
   employing critical coupling magnetic moment for indirectly detecting the
   fluid resistance torsion moment is proposed. To reduce fluid distorting
   effect, a petal-shaped capsule robot, whose surface is composed of four
   petal-shaped tiles, is proposed, and fluid resistance torsion
   moment-weaken effect of the petal-shaped capsule robot is discovered and
   investigated, which happens to the fluid when it travels through a
   convergent wedge-like gap between the surface of each of the four
   petal-shaped tiles and the inner pipe wall. Simulations and experiments
   have demonstrated that the twist impact on the GI tract by the
   petal-shaped capsule robot is reduced, while the non-contact driving
   performance in the GI tract is improved greatly isolated by fluid
   membrane with high dynamic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype camera for one of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
   projects for the small size telescopes, the single mirror Small Size
   Telescope (SST-1M), has been designed and is under construction. The
   camera is a hexagonal matrix of 1296 large area (95 mm(2)) hexagonal
   silicon photomultipliers. The sensors are grouped into 108 modules of 12
   pixels each, hosting a preamplifier board and a slow-control board.
   Among its various functions, this latter implements a compensation logic
   that adjusts the bias voltage of each sensor as a function of
   temperature. The fully digital readout and trigger system, DigiCam, is
   based on the latest generation of FPGAs, featuring a high number of high
   speed I/O interfaces, allowing high data transfer rates in an extremely
   compact design.}},

Abstract = {{Increased use of nonlinear loads injects current harmonics in electrical
   distribution networks and creates new problems of power quality in the
   power system. In today's competitive electrical market, electric
   utilities strive to supply consumers with reliable and pure sinusoidal
   electric power that does not represent a damaging threat to their
   equipment. In the restructured power system, prices of the power are
   associated to power quality. Hence, it is very important to monitor and
   ensure power quality. This paper presents an innovative way of real-time
   harmonic computing using intelligent microcontroller and its assessment
   with automatic meter reading (AMR) on smart phone. During preparation of
   this paper, fifty site visits are done covering the nonlinear loads like
   IT industries, steel industries, paper industries, workshops, etc. It is
   observed that the current harmonics generated are beyond the tolerable
   limits. Readings are taken at consumer end with the help of standard
   power analyzer for a period of 24 h. It is also observed that a good
   number of researchers have worked on harmonic studies in the power
   system network; however, their work does not fit into the framework of
   the standards applicable. The developed solution has the capacity to
   identify the normal and abnormal presence of harmonics with color code.
   Through this color coding technique, an unskilled worker can easily
   identify the objectionable presence of harmonics. The computing results
   are observed to be satisfactory and promising. It creates awareness in
   the utility for measurement and control of harmonics which in turn helps
   to improve the power quality.}},

Abstract = {{Global retailers are expanding their business to countries with diverse
   cultures and consumer preferences. Competitive and sustainable retail
   chains require advanced e-services linked to in-store digital
   innovations. This research focuses on cultural dimensions and the
   implications of implementing global and internet-linked e-service
   innovations. The research studies how cultural dimensions influence
   consumers' attitudes toward five types of retail innovations. The
   cultural dimensions include uncertainty avoidance and collectivistic
   cultural dimensions to predict acceptance. The research case compares
   differences between Taiwanese and Swedish university students. A
   multi-attribute model shows that Taiwanese prefer innovations with a
   lower level of self-service. On the other hand, Swedish prefer opposite
   types of retail innovations. We propose future research to show that
   these barriers of acceptance can be lowered through the use of
   advertising, social media, and in-store interaction between customers
   and staff. The research yields new research directions to help
   international retailers develop competitive strategies to fit the
   cultural characteristics of consumers.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION}},

Pages = {{838-859}},
Abstract = {{This article addresses the tension between innovation and imitation in
   the games industry based on a case study on a cloning conflict.
   Developing new games necessarily involves adopting existing elements,
   but recent disputes centering on alleged copying have gained prominence.
   What are the criteria to delineate legitimate inspiration from cloning?
   Given the ambiguous copyright situation, the legitimacy of imitation is
   contested. Drawing on discursive institutionalism, we investigate
   professionals' discussions around an alleged cloning case. We find that
   imitation is accepted practice in the industry. Originality can involve
   making small adjustments to existing games, but practitioners condemn
   wholesale copying of games. The article suggests that, even beyond the
   games sector, imitation is a necessary part of innovation. Discourses
   are important in governing innovation practices in creative sectors.}},

Abstract = {{MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are an innovation that have
   attracted public academic attention in recent times, and which have
   resulted in the evolution of e-learning (electronic learning) and so far
   have not achieved their expectations in Higher Education. This is due to
   the fact that from the outset these courses have faced a number of
   problems and questions regarding their acceptance, credibility, quality,
   methods of assessment, learning outcomes and more; which has generated
   controversy among their opponents, fans and even the creators of MOOCs.
   This work forms part of a doctoral investigation; in essence these are
   the results of the preliminary and exploratory stages in the research
   process, in which projections on the solution of some problems will be
   included. MOOCs: Their evolution, problems and challenges up to 2015,
   will surely help to minimize the high dropout rates of students in
   MOOCs, supported by mobile technology.}},

Abstract = {{Over recent years, interest has been growing in Bitcoin, an innovation
   that has the potential to play an important role in e-commerce and
   beyond. The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical
   study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their
   implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality
   theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are
   interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We
   discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity,
   the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and
   total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global
   survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the
   share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both
   ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-,
   customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the
   proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company
   features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about
   Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are
   significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who
   seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform
   vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency
   for online transactions.}},

Abstract = {{SDR has increasingly become an invaluable research, development, and
   educational tool within the telecommunications sector with respect to
   rapidly prototyping new algorithms and paradigms in actual radio
   hardware and evaluating them in real-world over-the-air conditions. Due
   to advances in microprocessor technology, radio frequency hardware, and
   software, SDR has matured into a reliable tool that is now part of
   almost every communication engineer's toolbox, and it has changed the
   way the telecommunication sector produces innovative solutions to
   technical challenges. In this article, we explore four case studies that
   highlight SDR as a reliable tool in industry, academia, and government.
   Specifically, we study four examples that illustrate: advances in
   low-cost, reliable, and versatile SDR platforms, open source and
   universal SDR software development environments, powerful technical
   computing environments employing SDR hardware for real-world
   experimentation, and educational paradigms for synthesizing digital
   communications and digital processing concepts using SDR technology. By
   understanding the impact of these case studies, we intend to provide
   some insight on how the SDR revolution has changed the way the world
   designs and implements telecommunication systems.}},

   using the spare parts technique for transferring his ring finger
   proximal interphalangeal joint as a pedicle to reconstitute the missing
   metacarpophalangeal joint of his middle finger. The soft tissue from the
   ring finger was rearranged to provide aesthetic coverage of the hand

Abstract = {{This study describes the innovative design of a digital measurement
   system based on a laser displacement sensor (LDS) as a vibrometer which
   is capable to measure a dynamic displacement response dependence on a
   stimulated vibration. The frequency response of a piezoelectric ceramic
   disc is obtained by processing the input/output signals obtained from
   the function generator and digital oscilloscope (digitizer) cards driven
   by a personal computer. Resonant frequencies of vibration are achieved
   utilizing the swept-sine signal excitation following the peak values in
   the signal response measured by LDS. The analogue signal from LDS
   controller represents directly a mechanical vibration of a piezoceramic
   disc. The test measurement results indicate that the system can
   distinguish resonance frequencies of piezoelectric ceramic discs up to
   40 kHz with the resolution 1 Hz. Piezoelectric coefficient d(33) and its
   linearity along the excited voltage amplitudes have been calculated by
   the applied methods as a demonstration of a successful system concept.
   The results achieved are in compliance with the reference value declared
   by the manufacturer of the piezoceramic disc. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{3D Printing technologies have received extensive attention in recent
   years, but empirical investigations of how this technology is used for
   manufacturing are still sparse. More knowledge is also needed regarding
   how 3D Printing affects the competitive dynamics between firms. This
   article explores how 3D Printing has been adopted for manufacturing and
   discusses under what conditions it might influence competition in
   different industries. Drawing upon data from the global hearing aid
   industry's adoption of 3D Printing during the period 1989-2008, this
   paper describes some of the benefits of using the technology, while also
   pointing out challenges firms encounter in making this transition. The
   study shows that early adopters were exposed to more technological
   uncertainty related to choosing printers. All firms encountered
   operational challenges as 3D Printing required new skill sets, but the
   technology had little impact on the competitive dynamics of this
   industry. Drawing upon literature on technological discontinuities,
   platforms and ecosystems, the paper illustrates and explains why the
   technology was not disruptive and also discusses how these findings
   apply to other industries where 3D Printing is currently gaining
   momentum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fabrication is an example of an industry in the making, as its
   value chains are not aligned, technical standards are in development,
   and markets are unclear. Alignment is necessary before business models
   can be employed and value creation can ensue, which is why DIGINOVA (a
   European consortium of parties interested in digital fabrication) took
   up the challenge of creating the strategic intelligence needed to power
   such alignment. This paper reports on this process. First, it outlines
   the need for alignment intelligence with reference to the underpinning
   dynamics of alignment in emerging industries; it then describes the
   technological scope of digital fabrication and the approach taken by
   DIGINOVA to produce such alignment intelligence and the outcome of this
   process in detail. It concludes with reflections on how this approach
   can be generalized beyond digital fabrication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All

Abstract = {{As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional
   components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data.
   The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require
   the use of tools, moulds or dies.
   Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic
   impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By
   constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems
   used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron
   Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper
   performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific
   costs, measured at 2.39 pound and 6.18 pound per cm(3) of material
   deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more
   widespread technology adoption of such additive systems.
   The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity,
   suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the
   adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications.
   Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also
   reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results
   reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic
   requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of
   innovation which are both found in the AM industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is a growing consensus that 3D printing technologies will be one
   of the next major technological revolutions. While a lot of work has
   already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in
   terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their
   impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history
   has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model
   evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing,
   the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these
   technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping,
   rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond
   to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production
   process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key
   business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and
   rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing
   and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly
   disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can
   become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model
   is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing
   technologies have the potential to change the way business model
   innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by
   bringing the `rapid prototyping' paradigmto business model innovation
   itself. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Digital fabrication including additive manufacturing (AM), rapid
   prototyping and 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize the way
   in which products are produced and delivered to the customer. Therefore,
   it challenges companies to reinvent their business model describing the
   logic of creating and capturing value. In this paper, we explore the
   implications that AM technologies have for manufacturing systems in the
   new business models that they enable. In particular, we consider how a
   consumer goods manufacturer can organize the operations of a more open
   business model when moving from a manufacturer-centric to a
   consumer-centric value logic. A major shift includes a move from
   centralized to decentralized supply chains, where consumer goods
   manufacturers can implement a ``hybrid{''} approach with a focus on
   localization and accessibility or develop a fully personalized model
   where the consumer effectively takes over the productive activities of
   the manufacturer. We discuss some of the main implications for research
   and practice of consumer-centric business models and the changing
   decoupling point in consumer goods' manufacturing supply chains. (C)

Abstract = {{The paper studies how producers and users benefit from reciprocal
   innovative activities. Ideally, such gains translate in an increased
   innovative dynamics of knowledge receivers, who accrue pecuniary
   knowledge externalities and take advantage of these external effects in
   their own activity. In principle, nothing prevents that, in an
   increasingly integrated world, knowledge externalities would be
   generated both in purely domestic as well as cross-country
   knowledge-based transactions. Nevertheless, the evidence reported in the
   paper suggests that localized rather than international knowledge
   externalities are dominating. In the empirical analysis based on a panel
   of 23 2-digit manufacturing and service sectors in 15 EU countries
   (1995-2007), dynamic panel techniques permitting to account for the
   possible reverse causality in the underlying relations are implemented.

Abstract = {{Journalism education has tended to respond slowly to developments in
   digital journalism, such as data journalism, despite or because of close
   links with the industry. This article examines the obstacles to
   innovation in journalism education with particular reference to data
   journalism, drawing on the literature, a review of stakeholders and
   course documents, and the author's reflections on developing a data
   journalism module as part of a new MA programme. It highlights the
   complexities linked to the particular demands of data journalism, and
   identifies critical issues around student satisfaction; reputation and
   job/career outcomes; relevance, currency and appeal; programme
   management; and coherence. Rather than holding it back, more specialized
   socialization could assist journalism education to innovate effectively,
   the author suggests.}},

Abstract = {{Tabletop devices offer an attractive environment for the creation of
   hybrid board-games that seamlessly integrate physical and digital
   interaction. However, the prototyping of Tangible User Interfaces
   involves the integration of physical and virtual aspects, challenging
   both designers and developers, and hindering the rapid exploration of
   richer physical interactions with the game. Although the recent
   appearance of tabletop frameworks has helped to lower the threshold for
   coding tangible tabletop applications, the cost is a serious limitation
   on the degree of expressiveness of the tangible interaction. This paper
   presents ``ToyVision{''}, a software framework for the prototyping of
   tabletop games based on the manipulation of conventional playing pieces.
   ToyVision architecture is based on a Widget layer of abstraction that is
   able to express the manipulation of playing pieces in the context of the
   game. This Widget layer supports a wide range of passive and active
   manipulations with conventional objects. Designers and developers can
   visually model all passive and active manipulations involved in their
   game concepts in a Graphic Assistant, and test them immediately in a
   tabletop device. The paper also describes a set of evaluation sessions
   which demonstrate that ToyVision has been effective in lowering the
   threshold of developing applications for tabletop devices, while being
   sufficiently expressive to give support to innovative concepts for
   hybrid games that fully explore the tangible feasibilities of
   conventional playing pieces.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{170}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{137-142}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: A body of work focusing on brain connectivity, language
   dominance, and motor laterality research suggests that reduced
   hemispheric asymmetry is a core feature in schizophrenia. However, there
   is little consensus about whether reduced dominance is present in those
   at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis.
   Methods: A total of 94 demonstrated right-handed neuroleptic free
   participants (38 UHR and 56 matched healthy controls) were assessed with
   structured clinical interviews and completed an innovative handwriting
   task using a digital tablet computer. A laterality quotient (LQ) was
   calculated using kinematic variables from the participant's left and
   right hands. A subset of the sample (26 UHR and 29 controls) returned
   after 12-months to complete clinical interviews in order to examine
   relationships between handwriting laterality and progression of
   psychosis risk symptoms.
   Results: The UHR group showed decreased dextrality compared to healthy
   controls. At the 12-month follow-up, decreased dextrality accounted for
   8\% of the variance in worsened positive symptoms within the UHR group.
   Conclusion: The current results suggest that disrupted cerebral
   dominance is also present in the ultrahigh risk period and that
   decreased dextrality may serve as a novel biomarker for the progression
   of psychosis risk. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of an
   innovative momentum-based dumbbell-training intervention on cognitive
   function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Subjects and methods: A total of 45 community-dwelling older adults with
   MCI were randomly assigned to either a dumbbell-training group (DTG;
   n=22) or a control group (CG; n=23). Participants in the DTG
   participated in exercise sessions three times weekly for 12 weeks. The
   primary outcome measures were cognitive function, including the
   Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) - Cognitive subscale, Trail
   Making Test part B, Digit Span Test (DST) - forward, and DST - backward,
   with secondary outcome measures being Timed Up and Go, functional reach,
   and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale.
   Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, participants in the DTG had
   significantly improved ADAS - Cognitive subscale scores compared to
   those in the CG (5.02 points, P=0.012). There was a significant
   within-group change (improvement) in Trail Making Test part B (33.32
   seconds, P<0.001) and DST -backward (0.41 points, P=0.025) scores. No
   change was observed for the DST - forward measure. Participants in the
   DTG also improved their functional mobility compared to those in the CG
   (Timed Up and Go, 0.81 seconds; P=0.043).
   Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence showing the potential benefit
   of momentum-based dumbbell training for improving cognitive function in
   older adults with MCI.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I examine the role of human and digital actants in
   various material and spatial configurations during the Programme for the
   International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) e-assessment
   events. It reports on an investigation into how data are produced and
   subsequently fed into statistical models that in turn produce analyses
   of skills in centres of calculation'. These data are then used to
   produce reports, scientific papers, marketing documents and
   visualizations that profoundly affect how we understand concepts such as
   literacy or skill. Drawing upon the theoretical resources of Actor
   Network Theory, this investigation employs a new and innovative
   methodology, trace ethnography, to follow the distributed agency of
   hypermobile digital actants. I examine the detail of e-assessment events
   and interactions between coded technologies and people and how these are
   translated into statements about what it means to be literate. This, in
   turn, highlights the role of non-governmental organizations in
   influencing educational and economic policy-making through the
   intensification of data production.}},

Abstract = {{For the first 25 years, three-dimensional printing was the domain of
   industrial manufacturing and engineering. Through the open-source
   movement and peer production, this disruptive technology has become more
   widely available. This article considers how the future development and
   use of three-dimensional printing may be facilitated or inhibited
   through intellectual property law and practice. Using a combination of
   technical, legal, and policy analysis, we conclude that the potential
   for patent infringement is a primary issue in the continued development
   of three-dimensional printing technology. When it comes to the printed
   objects themselves, copyright issues will be the main focus of this
   debate. As these issues become more pervasive, some copyright holders
   will find technology-based solutions to enforce copyright laws and
   restrict printing activities. A common recourse is digital rights
   management as a means for protecting intellectual property, but its use
   has the potential for imposing unnecessarily stringent limitations on
   the use of three-dimensional printing.}},

Title = {{Close range photogrammetry for dynamically tracking drifted snow
   deposition}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{141-153}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Snow drifting along with snow blowing is a major concern for
   transportation efficiency and driving safety in regions where it
   develops. Common means to mitigate snow drifting on roadways are snow
   fences. Designing snow fences requires sound engineering judgment and a
   thorough evaluation of the potential for snow blowing and drifting at
   the construction site. The evaluation includes site-specific design
   parameters typically obtained with semiempirical relations
   characterizing local transport conditions. Among the critical parameters
   involved in fence design and assessment of their post-construction
   efficiency is the quantification of snow accumulation at the fence site.
   Conventional methods for quantification of snow accumulation are
   tedious, expensive, and, given the harsh winter weather environment,
   risky at times. The present paper proposes an innovative assemblage of a
   close range photogrammetry (CRP) system to enable non-intrusive remote
   estimation of the snow deposit volume using real-time, automated data
   acquisition protocols. The study illustrates practical means for CRP
   implementation for snow mapping and tracking by highlighting the
   benefits and limitations of the method, comparing it with alternative
   measurement approaches, and pointing to circumstances where the
   technique is valuable for design and monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The increased digitization of organizational processes and products
   poses new challenges for understanding product innovation. It also opens
   new horizons for information systems research. We analyse how ongoing
   pervasive digitization of product innovation reshapes knowledge creation
   and sharing in innovation networks. We argue that advances in digital
   technologies (1) increase innovation network connectivity by reducing
   communication costs and increasing its reach and scope and (2) increase
   the speed and scope of digital convergence, which increases network
   knowledge heterogeneity and need for integration. These developments, in
   turn, stretch existing innovation networks by redistributing control and
   increasing the demand for knowledge coordination across time and space
   presenting novel challenges for knowledge creation, assimilation and
   integration. Based on this foundation, we distinguish four types of
   emerging innovation networks supported by digitalization: (1) project
   innovation networks; (2) clan innovation networks; (3) federated
   innovation networks; and (4) anarchic innovation networks. Each network
   involves different cognitive and social translations - or ways of
   identifying, sharing and assimilating knowledge. We describe the role of
   five novel properties of digital infrastructures in supporting each type
   of innovation network: representational flexibility, semantic coherence,
   temporal and spatial traceability, knowledge brokering and linguistic
   calibration. We identify several implications for future innovation
   research. In particular, we focus on the emergence of anarchic network
   forms that follow full-fledged digital convergence founded on richer
   innovation ontologies and epistemologies calling to critically
   re-examine the nature and impact of modularization for innovation.}},

Title = {{Beyond the Ask and Advise: Implementation of a Computer Tablet
   Intervention to Enhance Provider Adherence to the 5As for Smoking
   Cessation}},

Abstract = {{Background: The 5As for smoking cessation is an evidence-based
   intervention to aid providers in counseling patients to quit smoking.
   While most providers ``ask{''} patients about their tobacco use patterns
   and ``advise{''} them to quit, fewer patients report being
   ``assessed{''} for their interest in quitting, and even fewer report
   subsequent ``assistance{''} in a quit attempt and having follow-up
   ``arranged{''}.
   Purpose: This article describes the design of an implementation study
   testing a computer tablet intervention to improve provider adherence to
   the 5As for smoking cessation. Findings will contribute to the existing
   literature on technology acceptance for addressing addictive behaviors,
   and how digital tools may facilitate the broader implementation of
   evidence-based behavioral counseling practices without adversely
   affecting clinical flow or patient care.
   Methods: This project develops and tests a computer-facilitated 5As
   (CF-5As) model that administers the 5As intervention to patients with a
   computer tablet, then prompts providers to reinforce next steps. During
   the development phase, 5As' content will be programmed onto computer
   tablets, alpha and beta-testing of the service delivery model will be
   done, and pre-intervention interview and questionnaire data will be
   collected from patients, providers, and clinic staff about 5As fidelity
   and technology adoption. During the program evaluation phase, a
   randomized controlled trial comparing a group who receives the CF-5As
   intervention to one that does not will be conducted to assess 5As
   fidelity. Using the technology acceptance model, a mixed methods study
   of contextual and human factors influencing both 5As and technology
   adoption will also be conducted.
   Conclusions: Technology is increasingly being used in clinical settings.
   A technological tool that connects patients, providers, and clinic staff
   to facilitate the promotion of behavioral interventions such as smoking
   cessation may provide an innovative platform through which to
   efficiently and effectively implement evidence-based practices. (C) 2015

   the curation and preservation of popular music artifacts, drawing upon
   interviews with a range of archival institutions and popular music
   curators in several countries. It explores the current technological,
   financial, and aesthetic challenges facing curators and archivists in
   the era of digital abundance. Previous strategies of collecting
   everything are being revised, with more recent strategies of selective
   narratives of particular national significance. This in turn presents
   further challenges for institutions that wish to adopt more playful and
   innovative uses of their material, particularly as pressures mount from
   the state to increase user/visitor numbers. The article also explores
   how the national is configured in these forms and presentations of
   popular music and cultural memory, and where archives are situated
   between the music industries, the state, and popular music fan
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The article uses a conceptual framework to review empirical evidence and
   some 180 articles related to the opportunities and threats of Big Data
   Analytics for international development. The advent of Big Data delivers
   a cost-effective prospect for improved decision-making in critical
   development areas such as healthcare, economic productivity and
   security. At the same time, the well-known caveats of the Big Data
   debate, such as privacy concerns and human resource scarcity, are
   aggravated in developing countries by long-standing structural shortages
   in the areas of infrastructure, economic resources and institutions. The
   result is a new kind of digital divide: a divide in the use of
   data-based knowledge to inform intelligent decision-making. The article
   systematically reviews several available policy options in terms of
   fostering opportunities and minimising risks.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of increased human pressure on planet Earth, sound
   environmental governance regimes are more important than ever. Digital
   technologies are increasingly turned to by environmental regulators to
   aid governance and communication. We examine the `behind the scenes'
   institutional dynamics of a public body in its digital information
   provision (specifically dynamic river level information). Based on
   in-depth interviews with staff across a large environmental regulator we
   have brought to light four pivotal areas of institutional dynamics: (1)
   institutional priority and path dependency; (2) management and
   resources; (3) institutional identity and interdepartmental dynamics;
   and (4) ability and willingness to change. We gained insight into
   explicit and covert barriers and opportunities in relation to digital
   information provision that are likely to occur in other public
   institutions too. Besides identified barriers that were of a technical,
   structural, managerial or cultural nature, arguably the most important
   barrier was conceptual, i.e. the prevalence of `efficiency and efficacy'
   perspectives on information and communications technology (ICT) amongst
   staff, in which ICT is primarily perceived as a neutral solution in
   itself to a wide variety of issues. Opportunities were nonetheless
   present in the form of enthusiasm and some critical thinking about
   digital innovation among staff, and an emphasis on the importance of
   stakeholder inclusion in the design of ICT. We conclude that there is a
   need to connect institutional social learning with the development of
   `conceptual perspectives' on ICT, in which ICT is not seen as a solution
   in itself, but as a set of tools in a wider transformational process, or
   as a lens to look at existing or new practices. This is more likely to
   strengthen cornerstones of contemporary environmental governance, such
   as improved information access and reconceptualisations of `traditional'
   barriers of uncertainty, liability and distrust in relation to
   information provision. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two studies considered whether psychological variables could predict
   everyday music listening practices more than those demographic and
   technology-related variables studied predominantly hitherto. Study 1
   focused on music-listening devices, while Study 2 focused on music
   selection strategies (e.g. playlists). Study 1 indicated the existence
   of a one-dimensional identity based on music technology. Further,
   psychological variables (such as innovativeness and self-efficacy)
   predicted whether individuals possess such an identity. Moreover, while
   psychological variables predicted whether individuals preferred
   familiarized' advantages inherent to listening devices, a preference for

   2 supported the first study in terms of identity, and demonstrated that
   a different pattern of variables predicted playlist listening from
   listening to music via shuffle. More generally, the findings suggest the
   utility of applying constructs from consumer psychology to everyday

Abstract = {{The Digital Twin concept represents an innovative method to monitor and
   predict the performance of an aircraft's various subsystems. By creating
   ultra-realistic multi-physical computational models associated with each
   unique aircraft and combining them with known flight histories,
   operators could benefit from a real-time understanding of the vehicle's
   current capabilities. One important facet of the Digital Twin program is
   the detection and monitoring of structural damage. Recently, a method to
   detect fatigue cracks using the transformation response of shape memory
   alloy (SMA) particles embedded in the aircraft structure has been
   proposed. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic
   responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the onset of
   fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. In this work, the
   development of a finite element model of an aircraft wing containing
   embedded SMA particles in key regions will be discussed. In particular,
   this model will feature a technique known as substructure analysis,
   which retains degrees of freedom at specified points key to scale
   transitions, greatly reducing computational cost. By using this
   technique to model an aircraft wing subjected to loading experienced
   during flight, we can simulate the response of these localized particles
   while also reducing computation time. This new model serves to
   demonstrate key aspects of this detection technique. Future work,
   including the determination of the material properties associated with
   these particles as well as exploring the positioning of these particles
   for optimal crack detection, is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The text presents opportunities to use digital media and technology when
   working with literary texts in teaching German as a foreign language. In
   this context is being discussed the importance of digital media and
   their hermeneutic and didactic useful properties (accessibility,
   multimediality/hypermediality, interactivity). Based on theoretical and
   methodological literature are presented different opportunities for
   using various electronic resources, educational materials, electronic
   applications, platforms, tools, functions, types of tasks. In this way
   we support the argument that didactic use of digital media complements
   and enriches the traditional repertoire of teaming activities when
   working with foreign language literature texts. The goal is not only of
   building a common communication skills of those who study a foreign
   language, but also of stimulating their creative thinking and behavior,
   of building conscious and autonomous learners and developing aesthetic
   and media competence. The conclusion is that to achieve these goals in
   the current language learning practice through literature are mostly
   used the ``accessibility{''} and ``multimediality/hypermediality{''}
   properties of digital media. In recent times is often utilized and the
   ``interactivity{''}. The existing studies often try to comply both with
   innovative ways of teaching and communication, as well as aesthetic
   qualities of literary works.}},

Series = {{Routledge Critical Introductions to Urbanism and the City}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{1-33}},
Abstract = {{The cultural economy has emerged over the last three decades as a
   significant feature of urban development among both `advanced' and
   `transitional' societies, comprising a diversity of institutions,
   industries, firms and labour situated within both the production and
   consumption sectors.
   The cultural economy represents not a total break with earlier economic
   periods, but rather a complex blend of novelty (notably innovations in
   production and communications technologies) and more established
   development factors: capital, labour markets, production systems and
   space.
   While the growth of a `new cultural economy' of new media, digital
   pro-duction, cultural tourism and social media takes centre stage both
   in the popular imagination and in the aspirations of city officials,
   `culture' pervades every aspect of the city, including issues of
   identity formation, social organization, production modalities,
   performance and place. Each of these in turn contributes to shaping the
   structures and systems of the economy of the city and to urban
   development generally.
   Chapter 1 sets the scene for the book by identifying key themes
   associated with the cultural economy of the city and examples of
   influential scholarship for each, including: culture and urban growth
   and development; cultural production and consumption; culture and the
   reshaping of urban space; culture and community regeneration; culture
   and the built environment; and cultural industries and new rounds of
   gentrification.}},

Abstract = {{Digital technologies can have a revolutionary impact in the cultural
   heritage domain, not only in documentation and representation but also
   in communication and in the emerging field of digital ecosystems.
   Virtual environments allow the users to learn from experience, joining
   sensorimotor and interpretative faculties, perceiving, acting and
   adapting to changing circumstances, even if in contexts that are no
   longer (or not yet) materially accessible today. The challenge consists
   in the breadth of the field and the need to bring together an
   exceptional spectrum of disciplines, from cognitive science and
   psychology to history, archaeology, art, geography, computer sciences.
   Despite the exciting perspectives opened in education and in terms of
   social and economic growth, research in the domain of Virtual Museums
   has not reached a sufficient level of maturity, such as Cinema or Game
   sectors. There is still a disconnection between the research, that
   develops tools with little interest in their wide application, and the
   industry, that builds ten-year plans addressing the market. Virtual
   museums, the main focus of this contribution, have reached an important
   advancement but still today much of the research aims at technological
   innovation rather than at genuine culture transmission. Given the need
   of enhancing the emotional and cognitive impact of virtual museums, some
   criteria and good practices will be discussed, dealing with engaging
   storytelling, embodiment, novel solutions in the interaction design and
   in the integration of media. The theoretical discussion will be
   exemplified through concrete case studies, among which the Tiber Valley
   Virtual Museum, to give more evidence and a better clarification.}},

Abstract = {{Computer crimes and digital investigations comprise a substantial part
   of criminal policy, law and practice as information becomes the
   cornerstone of global economy. Innovative ways of attacking, exploiting

   regularly emerging, posing increasing threats to the society, economy
   and security. It is essential that in tackling cybercrime the right
   legal framework of offences is in place and that there is clarity in how
   the powers that are used to investigate cybercrime interact with the
   offences designed to catch cyber criminals. This paper reviews the
   current legal framework to cyber dependent crimes in the UK, including

Abstract = {{In this work, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for controlling robots is
   presented. The aim of this GUI is to enable simple and intuitive control
   of robots so students or non-expert users learn about mobile robotics
   using game-based strategies. Moreover, they become initiated into the
   world of robotics in a friendly manner. Combining technology learning
   and game-based strategies will engage current generations of ``digital
   natives{''} in their education.
   Successfully operating a robot implies deep experience and technical
   knowledge in advanced robotics. However, using the GUI presented in this
   paper, students will acquire this knowledge progressively and amicably.
   This work contributes to the inclusion of innovative techniques in
   education from a practical approach making students active participants
   in their learning processes. Students will get the feeling of being
   playing, while they get basic notions of robotics software and hardware.
   The provided system will work with robots equipped with Robot Operating
   System (ROS) framework and it will allow for controlling and monitoring
   the robot using different strategies. Using the GUI, students will be
   able to teleoperate the robot, varying its speed and direction; to
   command the robot to follow a person or another robot; to visualize the
   real-time images of the robot vision, among other functionalities.
   The interface has been developed combining ROS and Qt under the
   programming language C++. Thanks to this design, the system offers the
   possibility to include and integrate new functionalities easily.
   Finally, experiments on real robot operation through the proposed
   Graphical User Interface were developed using two robots: Turtlebot 2
   platform and mob.E, a developed robotic platform. The experimental
   results show the usability of the system and its feasibility for
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays the world is facing increasingly complex and challenging
   problems. Promoting education between the young generations is of the
   utmost importance in order to equip them with the most useful and
   powerful means to face this challenge. To do so we must see the world
   for what it is now, a place full of technology, where science is
   everywhere, from healthcare and infrastructure to energy and
   environment, just to mention a few; thus, helping children to develop
   skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) has become an
   important part of basic literacy in today's knowledge. Learning STEM is
   not only a bare and cruel necessity of life, it can be fun for children
   and as such, it could be a mean to convey other important ideas and to
   teach more effectively other subjects. The use of robots to help
   children approaching new concepts and ideas has been proving to be
   effective. We want to report here an example of how Robotics was used to
   make young learners, from eight years old to thirteen, think about
   active citizenship and environmental issues. The Italian Ministry of
   Education, University and Research (MIUR) strongly believes in widening
   the adoption of new methodologies that will allow technology to enter
   the classrooms in the Italian schools. This is proved by the latest
   Italian National Plan for Digital Education (Piano Nazionale Scuola
   Digitale - PNSD), a policy for setting up a comprehensive innovation
   strategy across Italy's school system, bringing it into the digital age.
   The project we want to present in this article belongs to PNSD bundle of
   initiatives. More in depth, the project ``Rethink Loreto: we build our
   Smart City!{''} is an innovative experience targeting the need to
   educate boys and girls to an active citizenship, developing their
   digital skills as well as the so-called soft skills. The project was not
   only a mean to talk about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and
   Mathematics) and Robotics with primary school children and lower
   secondary school students, but also a mean to equip teachers with new
   tools and methodologies, bringing the Maker philosophy and the Tinkering
   world into the school. Objectives of the project were to develop logical
   thinking, problem solving and construction abilities, to train students
   to use digital technologies and to stimulate attitude toward teamwork,
   encouraging interpersonal communication. Aim of the project was to think
   about the city of the future, considering the city as we know it now and
   imagining how to make it better with the use of technology and working
   with issues of automation, quality of life, energetic efficiency,
   accessibility and environmental sustainability. Four partners worked
   together in this project to reach these objectives. First of all, the
   school Istituto Comprensivo ``G. Solari{''} settled in Loreto (Ancona,
   Italy), in which all the courses took place. Secondly, TALENT srl
   (Technological Applications for Learning Empowerment and Thoughts), an
   innovative start-up with a social vocation, which represented the
   technological partner. Then, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, which
   is the University of the Local Region of Marche, representing the
   academic partner with the aim to formalize the work and to validate the
   results. Lastly, the Municipality of Loreto promoted the project and
   hosted the final exhibition of the results the project yielded to.}},

Abstract = {{According to data analisys produced in our research project ``The use of
   mobile technologies in the teaching and learning Processes at the
   university, the place of the digital video.{''}, being carried out by
   the research group TecMovAE (Mobile Technologies Applied to Education,
   at Universidad Tecnologica Nacional (Argentina), there are a growing
   number of social practices developed by students in the frame of their
   studies, using videos found in the Internet; these practices and the
   information contained in these materials are seldom taken into account
   by teachers and, therefore, they do not take advantage of them in their
   classes. Moreover, very often they explicitly or tacitly disqualify the
   videos available on the Internet as a source of relevant information for
   the different subjects. In these terms, a clear tension can be
   recognized: on the one hand, we found the above mentioned teacher
   opinions and the null or very small place they give to these materials
   in their daily work. On the other hand, we found the massive use that
   young people make both in their everyday and academic lives of
   audiovisual materials provided by the increasing connectivity which
   allows them to have access to these materials through their mobile
   technologies.
   Meanwhile, the number of audiovisual material published in the Internet
   keeps growing as well as the possibilities that could open up to improve
   teaching, if only the academics chose them, or at least considered them
   as tools for their work.
   Why do university teachers disqualify these materials? There is a rigid
   tradition: only the teacher is in charge of the selection of content and
   resources to be studied, and most of these materials cling to the text.
   But the most important response we find is the fact that the majority of
   them perceive the difficulty and vastness that making a change would
   imply, when faced to the task of exploring that immense territory called
   the internet. In this sense, having maps of this area could help
   teachers to know the options that their students have when searching
   videos to study, and as a synthesis of the various possibilities of
   audiovisual representation of the subjects' contents. Besides, the
   existence of these maps would make it easier to invite students to bring
   the videos they use in their academic activities in order, for example,
   to make a joint analysis of the validity of the information they
   contain, their articulation with other materials provided by the
   educator, etc. Besides, these maps would allow the visualization of the
   possibilities that these materials could open for academics, if they
   decided to incorporate videos to their classes, just as they are found,
   modifying them or why not? producing themselves their own tutorials.
   This paper focuses on two issues. The first presents the data analysis
   that sustain the former statements, The second presents the formulation
   of different maps of the tutorial videos available on the internet, as a
   first and necessary step to facilitate the academics appreciate the
   richness of the existing audiovisual materials, and therefore decide to

Abstract = {{Societal challenges such as the ageing population, inequality, energy
   security and others are global and transnational in nature. During the
   last years inclusive, innovative and reflective societies have started
   to search for a solution for societal challenges by promoting new forms
   of innovation and systematic engagement of citizens in the innovation
   process. However, the creation of a new kind of innovation culture
   requires broad cooperation of public administrations, organizations,
   companies, NGOs, universities, and creative individuals.
   Service design is seen as a significant driver for sustainable
   innovation regarding services as means for societal transformation.
   Service design approach provides methods and tools, not only for
   engaging citizens into open innovation process, but also for supporting
   both the designers and the citizens in their creativity and
   interpretations during the design process.
   This paper describes an experiment that addresses developing an elective
   study unit in service design at Laurea University of Applied Sciences.
   The objectives of the development work were: (1) to provide students
   with competence to use diverse development methods and tools flexible at
   all stages of the service design process; (2) to create sustainable
   social innovations in co-operation with citizens, public administrators,
   the third sector, companies, and technology developers; and (3) to
   create an open innovation process model to involve multidisciplinary
   students, citizens, companies, and the public and third sectors in the
   development of digital services.
   Action research was chosen as the research strategy for this development
   work due to its practical and hands-on nature. Action research changes
   things, not just to add academic knowledge. It is relevant that the
   researcher parties participate in the development process that proceeds
   in cycles. A cycle of action research consists of four phases: (1)
   planning, (2) acting, (3) observing and (4) reflecting. This study
   consists of three cycles.
   The development work was conducted during the multidisciplinary master's
   degree service design studies (2015-2016) in a project called WeLive
   (www.welive.eu). The WeLive project was devised to transform the current
   e-Government approach by facilitating a more open model of design,
   production and delivery of public services leveraging on the
   collaboration between the public sector, citizens and entrepreneurs.
   WeLive applies the service design approach to deliver next generation
   personalised digital services to citizens. For that, it contributes with
   the WeLive platform, an ICT infrastructure where stakeholders
   collaborate in the ideation, creation, funding and deployment of new
   digital services.
   The outcomes of the development work were (1) an improved teaching model
   in line with the service design process, with the aim of providing
   students with the ability to act as service designers and innovation
   processes developers, and (2) an open innovation process model to
   involve universities (multidisciplinary students), citizens, companies,
   and the public and third sectors in the development of public services
   and to facilitate rich interaction between citizens/communities and
   other stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering and technical degrees are difficult to teach and,
   consequently, have always been characterized by a large number of
   academic failures. That is the reason why different methodologies have
   been applied to classes of similar content in different countries {[}1].
   Among these methodologies, it is noteworthy to mention audio/visual
   resources as a useful tool to improve the teaching of coastal
   engineering {[}2], which means more students that pass the coastal
   engineering courses {[}3]. Moreover, use of GPS and Google Earth have
   also shown to be useful tools to improve the learning process {[}4].
   Nevertheless, the authors have not found anything about the use of
   ``rules of thumb{''} as a better way for students to improve their
   comprehension of the basic knowledge of an engineering subject.
   This paper shows the teaching experience on Maritime Engineering for
   undergraduate students of Civil Engineering in the School of Engineering
   at the University of Seville (Spain). The application of new information
   technologies in classrooms and advanced training in the use of finite
   element software tools and programming languages gives our students
   extremely powerful tools for solving very complex engineering problems
   with excellent results.
   However, the enormous effort invested by the students in acquiring this
   advanced knowledge and to be up to date in using and commanding on these
   technologies leads them to focus their main efforts, attention and
   skills just toward the numerical resolution of the problem, the
   efficiency of the implemented algorithm, and the programming language
   difficulties. This puts aside the essential and the critical sense of
   the accuracy of the results obtained by the algorithm. The students do
   not get the physical `feeling' of what's happening in the algorithm.
   We have included a teaching sequence in our lesson programs that always
   starts with an historical review of the different approaches used by
   engineers in their times in order to solve engineering problems from the
   seventeenth through the nineteenth century to today. This method makes
   the students to appreciate the importance and wits required by those men
   in the past in facing a difficult task when they didn't have a PC or
   powerful software.
   The ``rules of thumb{''} in engineering become a powerful tool for the
   digital native students which helps them make sense and enjoy the study
   and programming when they finally find out that their algorithm responds
   with reasonable accuracy and orders of magnitude to the result expected
   beforehand. Simply applying ``rules of thumb{''} and well-known
   approximations of the past, perhaps obsolete from a technical point of
   view, will help the student learn the process.
   Some examples will be given in this paper in order to show the use of
   these ``rules of thumb{''} or simplified models in class for teaching
   Maritime Engineering subject. Among them: the dimensionless stability
   number of Vicente Negro {[}5] for the design of the armour layer blocks
   in breakwaters, the Iribarren's wave drawings {[}6], the US Army Corps
   of Engineers Shore Protection Manual Graphs and plates, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of mobile devices in the classrooms are increasingly
   growing, but its use for education is still too slow. Many times the
   teacher does not know how to deal with so many smartphones and
   applications connected to a huge and attractive network.
   In contrast, the student is accustomed to finding technology in their
   day-to-day, but is frustrated when they do not see it, in the classroom.
   The use of digital tools as smartphones, tablets and most varied
   applications can and should be part of the classroom providing a more
   attractive and entertaining education.
   This paper presents the results of tablet use in the classroom and how
   to make effective this technology to the teaching and learning process,
   considering the regional context. For this was implemented classrooms
   smart, in the Amazon region, in which each classroom was equipped with
   one Smart Tv and forty Tablets connected to a Wi-Fi environment. The
   teachers were trained to use the technology and the methodology used in
   the classroom has been evaluated and adapted for use of mobile devices.
   This research was applied in 2015, in twenty classrooms with an average
   of 35 students per class. More than 160 teachers were trained and the
   disciplines that the technology was most uses were: Portuguese,
   mathematics and science.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of Technology in our Society and in particular in Education
   is an ongoing and critical task. There's also a huge disparity when it
   comes to technology access, whether due to socioeconomic factors, lack
   of resources, infrastructures development, knowledge and budget.
   I think it is needed a seriously debate about these crucial issues (pros
   vs cons) for the future development of our society. Maybe it is time for
   ``Reimagining the future of Education{''}, based on lessons learned,
   past experiences and future demands.
   Let's imagining for a while we were ``Teleported{''} into the ``Year
   2025{''}. close your eyes and try to ``imagine{''} how it looks like.
   Think about it for a minute. We can imagine a futuristic picture of the
   world, but all our pictures are different. Our imagination is restricted
   by our education, knowledge, background, and social environment. But our
   creativity has no limits.
   Try once again with an open mind, trying to reimage the space, the
   planet, our city; our hometown. will be something like a: ``Smart World
   2020{''} scenario. Think about the new society needs and demands, the
   new citizen's skills, the environmental challenges, the new Smart
   Ecosystems, the Internet of Things implications, the eHealth and
   Well-Being ecosystem.
   And now, try to find for the best answers to your futuristic vision of
   the world. Do you really think we are on the right track?
   ``If we wish to prepare a generation of citizens, entrepreneurs and
   leaders for the 21th. century who can face real-world problems, we must
   give them real-world problems to solve{''}.
   The future framework for smart digital education, leave permanently
   redefined from the impact of new technologies, communications and
   infrastructures development, experiences and case studies. And last but
   not least, all global experiences from a more interconnected
   perspective. We are talking about the ``Future of the Society{''}.
   Imagination, Innovation, Inspiration, Interaction, Interconnection and
   Improvement; a new paradigm pushing from the pillars of education ``that
   needs to be agreed and adapted to the reality of each environment,
   preventing breaks and digital divides in access to knowledge and
   technologies that impoverish citizens and therefore to society.
   I spent most of the time in my life working at the consultant level.
   Studying, analyzing, imagining and developing services and solutions for
   a Smart Sustainable Society. Strangling my brain with new ideas, and
   trying to put my imagination to work in a creative process. This was
   something automatic, but really hard. Now, I spend my time trying to
   understand why this process works this way, to help organizations to
   think and work in a most creative way, getting real value at the end of
   the creativity process.}},

Abstract = {{The need to adapt the subject's practices, during the Degree and Master
   studies, to the competences and to the professional profile has already
   been demnstrated. The agenda for the Modernization of the Higher
   Education, published by the European Commission in 2014, remarks the
   need to adjust the curricula to the labour market, to promote the
   business spirit and to enforce the links between learning, research and
   enterprise in Higher Education. In Spain, the surveys of the Quality
   Education Office of public Universities, show that students, both Degree
   and Master, award a good valuation of the theoretical education although
   remark the need to improve the practical education at the University.
   The aim of this innovative education action is to approach the students
   to the labor market, by means of the practices of the subjects, using as
   tools, the ICT and the flipped learning methodology. The action includes
   four steps: The first step is to get in contact with the companies and
   to prepare real study cases of interest for the companies, in which the
   students will work during the course. Secondly, audiovisual material and
   other documents regarding the problems to be solved will be prepared and
   uploaded to the e-learning Moodle platform. In third place the students
   will approach the real cases proposed, and they will try to find
   different solutions for the problem, choosing the most adequate ICT to
   solve the case. By this moment, all the necessary theoretical concepts
   that the students need, will be arising, and using the technique of the
   flipped classroom they will be facilitated by the teacher. The teacher
   will set some deliverables to follow the students learning process by
   cooperative or tutorial, face-to-face or digital classrooms. Following
   with the flipped classroom technology, the fourth step will be the
   presentation of the solutions adopted by the students, including the ICT
   used, to the classroom, establishing a feedback from the students and
   the teacher, in order to consolidate the learning. Finally, the teacher
   will select some student's solutions to be presented to the companies.
   The diffusion will be at three levels, i) centre, ii) university and
   iii) inter-university. The results will be, i) the improvement of the
   practical teaching in Higher Education by the use of real labour market
   problems, ii) the enhancement of the use of ICT tools to solve them and
   iii) the improvement of the teaching-learning process.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of society driven by the digital age has brought
   significant changes in the school dynamics and, in particular, in the

Abstract = {{Over the past couple of years, social media have dramatically changed
   the way education is delivered. The new digital tools that have allowed
   students to connect and communicate in ways that were unimaginable less
   than a decade ago are now playing a major role in taking education into
   a new level. Students, who are one of the major users of social media,
   are using these online platforms to improve their learning in a variety
   of subjects. For their parts teachers are also making use of these tools
   to enhance their teaching methodologies and to help students learn.
   An educational area that has witnessed an exponential growth in the use
   of social media platforms is language learning and teaching. Our
   objective in this paper is, therefore, to explore the potentials of
   using social media as innovative language learning and teaching tools.
   The findings of the study demonstrated that acquiring a new language is
   much more diverse and interesting with social media sites. In fact,
   given their educational benefits, social media enable language learners
   to get in touch with native speakers of a variety of languages. Though
   grammar and vocabulary and rules are well acquired at school mainly from
   non-native language teachers, and no matter what language activities or
   exercises are done in class, students may still need more opportunities
   to enhance the four language skills. Nevertheless, social media,
   distinguished by the constant availability of native `teachers', provide
   an innovative way and a live experience in which a language learner can
   practice his/her target language by interacting with native speakers in
   real time.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with the proliferation of video-sharing sites like YouTube and
   Vimeo, short videos have become a priority for education. Even the
   smallest and most distant schools want to include videos as part of
   their innovative approaches for community engagement. In this context,
   there is a growing demand for educators who may, for themselves,
   effectively create content in the digital format. Motion graphics
   explainer videos have become a popular alternative due to the variety of
   the so called do-it-yourself video makers now available in the market,
   most of them allowing easy composition with 2D and 3D animations. In
   this paper we focus on the creative rewriting and video animation of the
   content of two famous short stories: ``The invention of the orange{''},
   by Fernando Sabino; and ``The dinosaur{''}, by Augusto Monterroso. We
   name the effort a transcreation, a term used by advertising and
   marketing professionals when referring to the process of adapting a
   message to a new mode of expression (with an emphasis on the images able
   to ensure its adequacy to a particular audience), while maintaining the
   same emotional and epistemological implications as it does in the
   original one. Two animated videos produced by the authors to introduce
   issues about innovation and information technology are presented and
   discussed in terms of those possible challenges a short story and a
   do-it-yourself platform pose for the digital animated transcreation. We
   argue that the minimal grammar structure usually used in explainer video
   stories is not sufficient for a short story transcreation, and suggest
   that some cinematic and literary aspects related to the dramatization
   and reversal features of the stories are essential to make them
   successful.}},

Abstract = {{E-learning and mobile learning have found extensive application and use
   in all levels of typical education. Preschool education is already
   experimenting with new educational technologies and innovative
   educational scenarios. Given the fact that preschool pupils can hardly
   (if at all) read or write, however, special attention has to be given to
   the design and implementation of educational interventions that employ
   new technological media and address preschool pupils. This paper
   presents the design, development and evaluation of an educational
   intervention for a preschool class that took place in Athens, Greece in
   spring 2016. The educational objective is to exploit e-learning and
   mobile learning technologies in order to ``teach{''} or promote the
   subject of Emotional Intelligence in a class of preschool pupils. The
   focus of this project is dual: (i) to develop digital material that
   relies mostly on images and narration as opposed to reading or writing,
   and which pupils access via mobile devices (tablets), and (ii) to
   structure the material along with the educational scenario so that it is
   suitable for use by the pupil assisted by an adult: either the teacher
   in class or the parent at home. In order to answer a series of relevant
   research questions, the e-learning environment `` Discovering our
   feelings{''} has been designed and implemented in the moodle platform;
   it is addressed to preschool pupils and an assisting adult (teacher or
   parent) and it has been used as the central point of the educational
   intervention followed by evaluation. Results are very encouraging both
   as to the potential of mobile devices and e-learning to produce learning
   outcomes of high quality for preschool pupils, and as to the change of
   attitude of pupils and parents towards e-learning and mobile learning
   resulting from their experiences in this program.}},

Abstract = {{The use of IWB (Interactive whiteboard) as a pedagogical tool is recent
   in Mauritius. While various studies emphasize the impact of IWB in
   classrooms, this study focuses on the perception of teachers and
   examines the actual usage and efficiency of IWB in Mauritian primary
   classrooms. The aim of this paper is to evaluate both the teachers'
   perception and the use of IWB in teaching and learning. Observation and
   semi-structured interview schedules were developed based on a
   techno-pedagogical model {[}13]. The data collection tools consisted of
   questions about teacher-pupil communication, teacher-resource planning,
   pupil-resource interaction. Twelve teachers, who actively used IWB in
   their classrooms were selected as participants teaching in schools with
   different levels of learners. The findings show that teachers believe
   that IWB can be used to support teaching of different subjects. Results
   also reveal the following: (1) the use IWB supports classroom teaching
   and learning (2) it enhances learner's engagement and learning and helps
   in catering for the different learning styles of learners (3) using IWB
   can be a powerful pedagogical tool to enable teachers to gather feedback
   on learners (4) use of IWB can help in developing a community of
   practitioners. Moreover, there is a consensus on the contribution of
   this tool to three aspects of educational practice: (1) the presentation
   of information and resources, (2) the power of visualization in the
   interpretation of concepts and models, (3) the facilitation of
   interaction and organisation of activities with a whole class focus. The
   experience of this research further enables to feed back into theory,
   mainly with respect to communication within the digital classroom.}},

Abstract = {{University/industry collaboration is sometime seen as a mere training
   ground for the students. The setup is like this: The industry supply
   real life tasks, which the students then take on and deliver solutions
   to. This is of course beneficiary to the students - they train on real
   life tasks - and the industry partner gets a task done. Nothing wrong
   with that.
   But at Lillebaelt University of Applied Science (EAL) in Odense, Denmark
   we aim to take this further. We do this by adding the element of
   innovation to the mix. So the industry partner isn't supplying set tasks
   for the students, but giving them problems to solve to which the
   industry partner does not have a solution. They are problem areas that
   is at the fringe of the industry partner's own wish for development.
   In this way these ``fringe{''} problems represent an opportunity for the
   University to deal with areas, which the industry partners have not
   developed yet. In this sense the students, the industry partner, the
   teachers and the University become collaborators on the same mission.
   To take this strategy to the test the BA in Digital Concept Development
   at the Media and IT department at the University have for 5 years worked
   with the BISI project. BISI is an acronym for Building Interfaces for
   Social Inclusion. The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration
   between two educations. Students from two universities collaborate
   through a semester on developing and testing welfare technology, which
   will help children with special needs become included in society.
   The two bachelor programs in respectively Digital Concept Development at
   Lillebaelt University of Applied Science (EAL) and Social Educator at
   University College Lillebaelt (UCL) work together with users of welfare
   technology and partners from the welfare technology industry. The users
   come from two municipal institutions for children with special needs.
   The institutions present issues that hinder inclusion. The solutions for
   these issues are then developed by the students and presented to
   industry partners within the welfare technology industry as possible
   innovative products for further development.}},

Abstract = {{Technology is a powerful tool at extending and creating opportunities to
   innovate in higher education. That is why in this paper the main idea is
   to be able to benefit from innovations, create knowledge and get skills
   to succeed in Higher Education through technology. Creating networks in
   science and research areas and make them visible can help to disseminate
   the role that women play effectively in the society. Therefore, in this
   paper the possibilities that the network provides to empower the work of
   women in science are going to be analysed, to point out factors that can
   be make women more visible in society, in general, and in academia,
   specifically. Some challenges to think about are: (i) Create networking
   to help improve a digital identity in a global context, (ii) Create
   networking promote the creation of free relationships and help to reduce
   gaps and promote gender equality, (iii) Create networking let

Abstract = {{Innovation has a cost. It is often the case that museums trying to
   innovate, simply cannot afford what it takes to build truly memorable
   exhibitions. Lack of human resources and high-tech equipment makes it
   hard to create quality contents that could be shown to the general
   public.
   Nevertheless, universities' museums are usually embedded in an
   environment that has the potential to provide all the tools and human
   resources required. The only thing needed is to establish a proper
   strategy and an interaction facilitator platform - U.OpenLab - which
   enables creating, building and sharing knowledge about the museums'
   collections and the academic population. This will make it easier to
   distribute the aforementioned knowledge to the general public, in a
   truly sustainable, systematic, integrated and articulated manner.
   In this paper we are going to present the University of Porto (U.Porto)
   OpenLab prototype that is being built as the stepping stone of this
   project, providing students with learning in a project environment.}},

Abstract = {{Project-based learning offers a student centered pedagogy and a dynamic
   approach which promotes a deeper knowledge through real-world challenges
   and problems solving.
   The U.Openlab concept is developed at the University of Porto (U.Porto)
   in the context of the teaching/learning process and is assumed to be an
   interaction facilitator platform between real-world needs and practical
   works topics. The aim is to provide innovative answers and the effective
   use of assessment results, the credits recognition for future
   professional or scientific careers and a sustainable process oriented
   for, among others, universities heritage services' needs.
   The pilot-project in course at the University of Porto, focusing on the
   U.Porto Digital Museum, includes a technological infrastructure with
   three main components: several collections, an information and services
   management platform, with its corresponding digital repository; the
   U.Porto community contributions management platform (U.Porto OpenLab);
   and an adaptive framework that will support various interface
   applications with non-specific audiences.
   The U.Porto OpenLab considers two main areas: the bidding management
   area/calls for contributions and a contributions personal management
   area. The professor, the student and the ``client{''} are the actors in
   the process. As for main tasks we point out the reception, selection and
   distribution of real needs/problems. Having concluded the assessment
   process, results were selected and an online publication was submitted.
   The inherent credits are recorded in a contributors' digital portfolio
   management and in the professional social networks profiles.
   The methodology will be presented and discussed as well as the process
   along with the obstacles and other factors contributing to the success
   and future replication of this experience.}},

Abstract = {{Learning style changes from generation to generation. The current and
   incoming tech-savvy learners grow up with the digital world. The
   advancement of technologies makes learning more accessible. As one of
   the examples, mobile learning has become a commonly accepted and
   embraced concept among the younger generations. Effective learning
   occurs when the teaching styles align well with the learning styles. To
   better serve the need of the next-generation learners, a mobile learning
   module consisted of three components, namely numerical analysis,
   simulation and experiment, is developed for an undergraduate upper
   division class, Mechanical and Structural Vibration, at San Francisco
   State University (SFSU). Besides delivering the theoretical knowledge of
   the important concepts in vibrations, such as natural frequency,
   equation of motion, and transfer function, the learning module also
   allow students further examine the gained knowledge through simulations
   in the developed interactive Apps. In addition, the module also includes
   a mobile remote shake table laboratory (RSTLab) which provides students
   the opportunity to remotely participate and conduct physical shake table
   experiments in real-time through smart mobile devices (e.g. smartphones
   and tablets). Through these physical experiments, students may easily
   build or modify scaled structural models to test theories and implement
   their own innovations to observe how these structures behave under
   different excitations. A telepresence robot is innovatively adopted to
   integrate with the mobile RSTLab to actively engage students and provide
   them a real sense of in-person participation without the need of being
   physically present in the laboratory. In this paper, the mobile learning
   module as well as the RSTLab will be demonstrated in detail. The
   implementation of the learning module is underway.}},

Abstract = {{Dental students must have beside the theoretical knowledge, a lot of
   visual and practical abilities. They should be able to cope with varied
   concrete situations and to apply a combination of good theoretical cases
   understanding with first class psychomotor skills. These needs have been
   quenched in the last years by the advances in Information and
   Communications Technology (ICT), which allowed the creation and usage of
   3D dental/oral system models. They are included in the e-learning
   systems for dentistry, bringing new ways to obtain learning, practical
   training and evaluation compared to the classical education. The usage
   is both theoretical, with the inclusion for visualization in atlases,
   exploration models, surgical planning, e-learning platforms etc., and
   practical with the inclusion in Virtual Reality interactive training
   tools or with the creation of 3D printed standard physical models to be
   used in the practical training.
   The 3D models support and improve the quality of teaching by introducing
   modern information technologies, facilitating the learning of new
   concepts and increasing the responsiveness and competitiveness among
   learners. The general prototypes are complemented these days with
   particular models created digitally or imported from the patient cases.
   They counterpart the classical examples with particular, novel ones,
   insuring the innovative learning and the capability to respond soundly
   to novel situations. One of the methods used to obtain these models is
   using 3D reconstruction from the Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT)
   data, the current standard in dentistry imaging. The data obtained using
   the CBCT procedure is in the form of a transversal CT sections stack
   through the body, stored in Digital Imaging and Communications in
   Medicine (DICOM) format. The regular approach to convert these images
   into the 3D model of the region of interest comprises image
   pre-preprocessing, segmentation of the elements in the preprocessed
   images, alignment or registration of the segmented objects and finally
   3D reconstruction of the registered elements. The 3D reconstruction for
   the dental structure is a difficult problem, with lots of papers
   treating the subject because of several issues: noisiness and low
   contrast due to the low amount of radiation, connectivity of the
   segments, bad positioning, section shape changing and low resolution.
   The paper describes the exploiting of 3D models in dentistry learning
   because of the domain importance, complexity and needfulness. The
   reconstruction from CBCT data is analyzed as one the most important
   methods to obtain 3D models corresponding to real cases and the benefits
   of these models in dentistry learning are shown.}},

Abstract = {{This study was a research collaboration between a School of Public
   Health and School of Education supported by a government grant to a USA
   university. The researchers explored the relationships between health
   disparities in schools and factors that affect the quality of teaching,
   learning and the learning environment in a digital age. The research
   addressed the problem from three dimensions 1) teacher quality, 2)
   student performance and 3) health and environmental related data for two
   selected schools. A literature review on the effects of ecological and
   technological conditions have on schools showed there are significant
   health risk is some schools. The argument is that such conditions
   present thought-provoking implications for transforming learning
   environments into healthy and safe places for teachers and learners to
   be active and productive in a digital age. Preliminary research focused
   on USA schools and revealed a high-quality teaching environment is
   expected to demonstrate five key conditions and five helping brain-based
   behaviors in teaching 1) lesson clarity, 2) instructional variety to
   address diversity, 3) healthy and safe learning environment, 4)
   engagement in the learning process, and 5) student success. Methodology
   includes mixed methods, explanatory research design to gather evidence
   of the relationships between variables and potential adverse effects of
   health and ecological conditions on teachers and students. Data
   collection and analysis methods include: Literature review, survey and
   interviews. Research sites include two selected schools - one
   rural/suburban and one urban/inner city school. The central research
   question is: What Critical Factors contribute to understanding and
   Creating and Maintaining Safe, Sustainable and Healthy Digital Age
   Learning Environments in Schools that Serve High Need Learners with
   Disparate Health Conditions? This presentation will share findings on
   the potential implications for disparate conditions in schools and
   communities that can affect individuals and overall school performance.
   The research is important because it calls attention to the need to
   acknowledge problems involving healthy and safe infrastructure,
   environmental conditions and the impact on individuals health, which
   often result in adverse affects on teaching and learning performance in
   schools in this digital age society. The research is expected to advance
   future research designs and funding to investigate creating, maintaining
   safe and healthy digital age environments globally. The findings and
   results emerged from literature reviews, scientific research and field
   experiences for the phenomenon investigated in this study within school
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the findings from a preliminary study of
   teachers' understanding of cyber ethics. According to the revised
   Norwegian curriculum {[}1, 2], teachers in Norway need to incorporate
   cyber ethics in all subjects in school. In the Norwegian curriculum,
   cyber ethics includes knowledge of copyright laws online, privacy and
   data protection online, source awareness and knowledge of how to behave
   online, which is often described as netiquette. To a certain extent,
   cyber ethics represents an innovation in schools because of its mostly
   new and explicit content, highlighted by developments in technology and
   the increased use of social media.
   This article is based on interview data from five teachers in different
   primary and secondary schools in Oslo, Norway. The aim of this article
   is to gain insights into how teachers in schools understand the concept
   of cyber ethics and how they practice and develop pupils' cyber ethics.
   We approach our study from a diffusion of innovations (DOI) perspective
   {[}3]. This perspective has been used to understand why and how various
   innovations have been adopted, have not been adopted and who adopts
   innovation. This approach has also been applied in the field of
   education and educational technologies {[}4, 5].
   Our findings indicate that the characteristics of innovation, such as
   complexity, hinder diffusion, whereas compatibility eases its entry into
   practice. Teachers primarily address some of the ethical and moral
   aspects of cyber ethics, such as source criticism, digital bullying and
   netiquette. These are aspects that are already traditionally grounded in
   schools. Source criticism is an inherent part of Norwegian language
   learning and social science. Schools have traditionally had strategies
   against bullying, and cyber-bullying is, to a certain extent, an
   extension of bullying. Teachers report that they take up cyber-bullying
   issues, as well as netiquette issues, when cyber-bullying issues occur.
   The legal aspects of cyber ethics, such as copyright and privacy, are
   complex and less visible in teachers' approaches to teaching and
   promoting cyber ethics in class. The teachers pointed out that they have
   little knowledge of copyright and therefore experience difficulty in
   communicating this aspect of cyber ethics in teaching. Furthermore, the
   teachers' understanding of privacy is fragmented and communicated
   through the use of external content providers.
   Cyber ethics is relatively well defined in the Norwegian curriculum, so
   teachers' lack of a holistic understanding of the concept is, to some
   extent, surprising. Consequently, cyber ethics has limited diffusion in
   schools. Taking a diffusion of innovation approach to cyber ethics has
   given us insight into issues at stake, and in why certain cyber ethics
   topics are integrated and implemented, and why others are not.}},

   The implementation of the EHEA in Spanish universities involves a
   process of change from the previous model, making it necessary to
   incorporate a system for teaching innovation according to the proposed
   reform. The university system should be adequate to this environment.
   The main aim of this project is to analyze how technological innovation
   contributes to improving teaching quality in the area of Marketing and
   Market Research at the University of Alcal. To do this, several
   educational innovations have been designed and implemented.
   Specifically, students have been organized into teams and with the
   guidance of the teacher, with the use of the virtual platform, question
   sheets, synthesis sheets, the creation of virtual resources, making a
   creative dynamic environment and incorporating English into business
   management simulators. The results show a positive perception in

Abstract = {{The massive presence of digital gadgets and tools has changed our lives,
   mainly as the result of Internet technology. The active role played by
   the Internet user (prosumers according to Toffler, 1979) has provided a
   new way to connect with knowledge, characterized by new sources of
   culture and agents of knowledge, new styles of social participation and
   interaction, and new forms of contents management and creation
   (Buckingham, 2005; Pisani y Piotet, 2010; Lopez y Angulo 2015). At a
   time in which culture is liquid (Bauman, 2006), the educational task
   becomes more complex and requires a restatement of the educational
   training and its professional nature. University Degrees on Education
   have the responsibility to respond to the new ways of teaching and
   learning which are required by the present digital scenario.
   This paper presents the results of the research carried out in the
   Faculty of Educational Sciences of the University of Cadiz (UCA) which
   analyzes digital competences of students in Primary and Infant Education
   Degrees. The collected data are going to be organized according to the
   following spheres: timings, spaces and uses of ICTs; the analysis of
   communicative competences and collaborative learning and information
   search and management, and the analysis of the level of relevance given
   by the students to the mastery of ICTs as undergraduates in Educational
   Sciences and as future teachers. This study involves a reconsideration
   of the Study plans for Educational Sciences in the Information and
   Knowledge society.
   The SPSS has been used for the analysis of quantitative data; likewise
   the categorization research has been used for qualitative or textual
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing internationalisation of university education systems
   requires new tools and procedures to satisfy new needs. The need to know
   foreign languages, for example, is driving a key competence at the
   higher education level, with a corresponding increase in innovative
   projects aimed at improving language learning and pedagogy. In this
   respect, the teaching approach known as CLIL (Content and Language
   Integrated Learning), in which the learning and teaching of language and
   subject matter is totally integrated, has gained enormously in
   popularity, especially, perhaps, in technical subjects. In addition, a
   type of blended learning incorporating ICTs (Information and
   Communication Technologies) is nowadays mainstream in university
   curricula. In fact, the pedagogical implementation of ICTs in higher
   education offers a considerable degree of authenticity, since nowadays
   nearly all students are digital natives and feel comfortable with the
   use of ICT tools. Nevertheless, not everybody uses the same ICTs, to the
   same degree and in the same way. Having a deeper understanding of what
   ICTs students in a specific teaching programmme use, and in which way,
   would certainly help the teachers to better implement these technologies
   in the classroom. And it would also assist the pedagogical development
   of efficient ICT-based learning materials and resources. With this
   general context as background, this study departs from the idea of an
   innovative collaborative project devised to take place between the
   Universidad Nacional de Colombia, in Bogot, Colombia, and the
   Universitat PolitScnica de ValSncia, in Spain, called BEELT (Building
   Engineering through English Language Learning), whereby teachers of
   Civil Engineering follow a CLIL approach in a team-teaching environment,
   i. e. a language and a subject-matter teacher working together in the
   classroom. The researchers involved in this project wanted to know how
   students use ICTs in their daily lives. Consequently, the overall aim of
   this study is to ascertain certain habits of use of ICTs by university
   students, both in Colombia and in Spain, in order to compare the data
   and to draw some useful conclusions so as to design and develop
   ICT-based learning resources and materials that can adequately match the
   students' learning styles, methods and habits. In so doing, the study
   also proposes a methodology for developing learning materials which
   could be used in similar CLIL educational contexts that make broad use
   of ICTs. This methodology involves the incorporation of information on
   how students actually use ICTs in practice. First, the rationale of the
   project is briefly discussed, including its major pedagogical
   components, namely CLIL, TELL (Technology-enhanced language learning),
   active methodologies and Team Teaching. Second the research methodology
   (involving carrying out a simple survey to Colombian and Spanish
   students and including questions about the use of ICTs in their
   learning) is described. The results are later presented, interpreted and
   used to inform the development of ICT-based learning materials. Finally,
   this is used to propose a possible working methodology to develop
   learning materials in other similar contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The recent jump of digitalization in our lives represents one of the
   major drivers of change in the new century. In 2011, the German
   government introduced the term ``Industry 4.0{''} to indicate the
   potential fourth industrial revolution. The term is extending to cover
   wider areas other than just the industry. Within the same context of the
   technological revolution, researchers started to investigate what effect
   this revelation can leave on different life sectors. Hence, terms such
   as ``Cities 4.0{''} and ``Language 4.0{''} started to be used. This
   concept covers higher education and the current teaching methods.
   Meaning that education has to adapt to new methods to follow up with the
   changes happening with technology. The need of establishing a new
   concept to enable and utilize the full potential and acceptance of the
   technological change brought into education becomes more urgent every
   day. The paper gives a first definition of the Teacher 4.0 and extend
   the discussion to the challenges and requirements that are facing it.
   For this study, different teaching scenarios are derived to cope with
   the current technological revolution in context of industry 4.0. Within
   these scenarios, innovative technologies were used introducing new
   teaching methods. The presented scenarios of Teacher 4.0 are analyzed in
   comparison with traditional teaching methods in a form of ``scenario
   thinking{''} or as known as ``scenario analysis{''} method aiming at
   identifying key challenges and requirements for the future teachers.
   Three categories are presented: human-based and didactical,
   technological as well as organizational. The short summary gives an
   outlook of further required steps for teachers in order to adapt new
   technologies in higher education.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a series of key developments and interventions that
   have enabled a platform for digital innovation in the management and
   administration of the assessment and feedback processes within a top 10
   UK University.
   The joined up platform of technological solutions and associated
   transformative staff practices demonstrated a wide impact on efficiency
   and productivity across the organisation. The initiative adopted new
   approaches to innovation and change to help deal with two major
   challenges:
   1 Addressing the technical, organisational and cultural complexity of
   such a programme of work.
   2 Addressing the challenge of limited resources with which to deliver
   lean, practical and useful digital solutions that can be efficiently and
   effectively adopted by staff and scaled up across the institution.
   OUR CHALLENGE -Members of staff use a disparate set of learning
   technologies and desktop software to create and deliver assessments and
   to mark work and provide feedback to students. Each department and
   School tended to operate using a different set of procedures and forms
   to issue assessments and collect submissions, register participation and
   provide feedback. There was no clear and consistent mechanism to return
   work back to students or to check the consistency and quality of
   feedback. Individual practices and attitudes varied and academic staff
   needed to be convinced that new ways of working would be better for
   themselves and their students, especially with regards to adopting and
   accepting new technologies.
   OUR APPROACH - This paper describes the pragmatic and agile way in which
   a small team set out to try and improve things one step at a time with
   the limited resources that were available to them. This initiative was a
   community driven activity taking an agile and very lean approach to
   change. It was recognised that changes to pedagogic and administrative
   practices, as well as development of a variety of digital solutions
   would be required.
   THE SOLUTION - The digital platform developed (containing 5 components)
   comprises; features for assessment planning; communication; collecting
   data on submissions; collating data on feedback and returns; using the
   data to provide actionable insights in student engagement and staff
   practices; support a feedback dialogue between multiple staff and
   students; create a digital platform architecture underpinning multiple
   assessments, submissions and feedback types and applications; the
   creation of an assessment and submission data standard in order to join
   up data in disparate systems.
   DIGITAL INNOVATION - All staff embraced new social and technical
   methodologies to address pedagogic practices and technical hurdles.
   2014/15 marked a significant year in the process of development and
   adoption. The CASPA application became a mature, useful and highly used
   product. The roll-out of stand-alone kiosks and integration of
   assessment and submission data into the tutoring system Co-Tutor, was so
   successful, that adoption went from 4 departments to 9 in one year with
   minimal need for advocacy or support. Systems integration work via a
   data warehouse, creating a taxonomy for assessments, submissions and
   feedback data, is innovative in the sector allowing multiple learning
   technologies to `talk to each other' effectively.
   This paper will be of interest to practitioners and IT staff who are
   involved in the development, implementation and embedding of systems and
   process in their own universities.}},

Abstract = {{Looking through the lens of UCISA technology enhanced learning survey
   data and case study research, this paper discusses recent developments
   in technology enhanced learning across the UK higher education sector
   and considers the extent to which flexible provision and student-centred
   learning are now being supported by higher education institutions
   through their use of learning technologies. The evidence suggests that
   whilst there has been significant investment in TEL infrastructure and
   services across the UK HE sector in recent years, with strong `top down'
   support for digital services from senior managers, the mainstreaming of
   technology-mediated pedagogies in support of the learner has yet to be
   realised. The paper concludes that for student-centred TEL design
   approaches to take root across the sector, greater attention by
   institutions will be needed to developing enabling policies and
   evidence-based illustrations of blended and fully online design
   approaches - drawing on the effective use of learning technologies.
   Additionally institutions should offer incentives for academic staff in
   terms of time and support to help them to develop their digital craft
   and to fully embrace flexible learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing accessibility of computation and fabrication technologies
   in 21st century, ranging from advanced parametric modeling to 3D
   printing, have dramatically altered the landscape of design education in
   providing a nearly boundless productivity plain of design
   representation. This Third Industrial Revolution is a function of the
   confluence of increasing computational power and diminishing learning
   curves and technological barriers. Though this accessibility of
   technology has empowered emerging designers with the liberty to free
   themselves of conventional design tropes and investigate innovative
   ideas, the ease of generating imagery and physical representations of
   fantastic concepts has only widened the pedagogical gap between
   theoretical, academic pursuits and feasible projects for built reality.
   As digital design tools gain ubiquity in contemporary academic settings,
   a pedagogical framework must be established to ensure students can
   leverage the incredible potential these tools hold as channels for
   bridging conceptual innovation to application in the real world.
   D'Arcy Thompson's seminal work, ``On Growth and Form{''}, in the early
   20th century proposed a complement to Darwinism as it outlined a
   holistic view of interconnected systems the ultimately dictate the
   unique forms found in biological structures. If Darwin's natural
   selection serves as an analog for the iterative, conceptual design
   process, then Thompson's structuralism serves as a basis for designers
   to develop their ideas beyond the virtual and representational into
   tangible reality. The authors of this paper posit five key tenets of a
   design pedagogy ``structuralism{''} that educators may use to drive
   design innovation without compromising feasibility. These would include
   a project's: a) physical constraints and natural forces, b) internal
   capacity and context, c) external stimuli and response, d) production
   and reproduction, and e) role as an iteration of a greater evolutionary
   idea.}},

   archive: previously several hundred novels of the nineteenth century
   could be studied, now it's possible to analyze thousands, tens of
   thousands, and soon hundreds of thousands of texts. The article observes
   the problem to identify the meaning in statistically large sets,
   establishing patterns and their relationship with forms. If we turn the
   daily experience of reading literature in the abstract distributions,
   after we find the patterns and isolate patterns of formal relations that
   underpin them, it would be the last, and for many of us the main step:
   use all these innovations to return to the sociological understanding of
   literature in a completely new basis.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance and reinforcement of structures of gender and race are
   central to a discussion on identity politics and intersectionality in
   mental health services research. The goal of the Saving Our Sisters'
   (SOS) digital archive project (www.savingoursistersproject.com) is to
   have a space where Black women can find healing in others' moments of
   clarity about self-love, self-care, mental health, and well-being.
   Inspired by bell hooks's discourse on the gaze and rooted in community
   psychological research with a Womanist approach, the S.O.S. Project
   builds upon intrinsic motivation as applied to the mental health and
   well-being for Black women. The impact of the S.O.S. digital archive
   project has implications for both public health and mental health policy
   and practice, but most importantly for Black women. By focusing on
   community members' perceptions of mental health and well-being, Black
   women begin to strengthen relational and shared experiences and promote
   agentic health behaviors as an act of social justice. Additionally, this
   essay includes a lesson plan outline that provides outcomes, strategies,
   and assessments for teachers to design a lesson plan that will teach
   their students how to write personal narratives and transform them into
   digital technologies for social engagement, innovation, and
   intervention. The goal of the lesson plan is to allow teachers to engage
   deeply with the essay and to then determine and develop the best
   strategies for helping their students enter into and fully engage with
   the topic.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at the problems existed in the teaching process of algorithm
   courses in computer specialty, this paper combined the current teaching
   philosophy with the author's own teaching practice, discussed a kind of
   teaching reform mode for algorithm courses in computer specialty under
   the assistance of network teaching platform, in order to stimulate the
   learning interest and enthusiasm of students in the process of education
   teaching, to enhance the teaching effect, to improve the students'
   autonomous learning ability, innovation and practical ability.
   In the process of teaching in computer specialty, the algorithm course
   plays a decisive role, especially has an irreplaceable position for
   training students' ability to use computer to solve practical problems
   in production. The training program in computer specialty involves many
   algorithm courses, not only have professional basic courses, such as
   data structure, algorithm analysis and calculation method, but also have
   some professional elective courses, such as digital image processing and
   computer graphics. In addition, some colleges and universities also
   offer the elective courses such as artificial intelligence and pattern
   recognition for the senior undergraduate students in computer specialty.
   These algorithm courses in computer specialty, not only require students
   to have solid mathematical foundation knowledge and strong programming
   ability, but also require students to have strong ability of independent
   learning and innovation. Traditional teaching mode of ``teachers teach
   in classroom, students verify by experiment{''} has already can not
   adapt to the current teaching requirements in colleges and universities,
   it is difficult to bear the responsibility of higher education to
   cultivate innovative talents. Therefore, the teaching reform of
   algorithm course in computer specialty is an important task that the
   current universities faced. At present, the new teaching mode
   represented by MOOC brought great impact and influence on the
   traditional teaching mode, at the same time, but also provided a new way
   for the traditional teaching reform. In the current environment, how to
   draw lessons from these new types of teaching mode, reforming and
   innovating the teaching mode of algorithm courses in computer specialty
   is a urgent problem that computer specialty education faced in colleges
   and universities. This paper combined these new teaching modes with
   teaching practice, discussed the teaching mode reform of algorithm
   course in computer specialty, in order to stimulate students' learning
   interest and enthusiasm in the process of teaching, to guide students to
   autonomous learning, so as to improve the teaching effects of algorithm
   courses in computer specialty, to cultivate students' innovation spirit
   and practice ability.}},

Abstract = {{Today, Politics is undergoing change, change means to provide
   opportunities for direct election of people who are not involved daily
   in practical politics can be a leader in the area, Ridwan Kamil position
   represents the opportunity. This used to be the leader should go into
   the bureaucracy or become members of political parties. Today, everyone
   has the same opportunity. Both of these technological changes that
   cannot be avoided, wear first mobile phone for sms and call his
   business, now use mobile phones to all matters, examples of two
   different generations. Due to the ease of using a smartphone,
   information flow becomes faster, there is less community groups have
   time to read newspapers, watch TV, because it has shifted to online.
   Thus was born a new media, social media such thing, is popular in
   Indonesia, one of the contributors to happiness is social interaction
   the duo could be physical, and can be digital interaction. Government of
   Bandung is measured in three things : integrity, public services, and
   professional. Public expectations, had not a channel, send a formal
   letter. This is because the public expectation is high, the local
   government is only 20\% who have twitter, now all departments have a

Abstract = {{Web became the privileged place where public opinion is built. We were
   interested in the way the most read digital media treat information
   which touch at the heart of the social organization. To reach there, we
   studied the way these media investigated the official advice of the
   Observatory of the secularism on the secularism into the University of
   December 15th, 2015. There were several reasons for that: on one hand
   the major political importance of the public university which covers the
   territory, forms the youth, and produces research and innovation, and on
   the other hand the indivisibility of the French secularism and the
   democracy. First result: none of the most read media analyzed the text
   which is presented as a work of legal experts. We therefore sought what
   the press did not say by studying the parliamentary debates of the 1905
   law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
   It turned out that the text of the Observatory of the secularism was
   contrary to the one and the other.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to study how Indian public discourse is increasingly
   being subsumed by the politics of religious polarization. An ongoing
   project, with roots that go a long way back, has fine-tuned its reach
   into the digital platforms for greater access. At a time when
   innovations in Digital Humanities struggle to humanize a technologically
   driven world, the faithful of all religious denominations have taken to
   the social media to expand their campaign trails into consolidating
   their power bases. In a country of bewilderingly diverse ethnicities,
   religions and languages, secularism is a necessity, so as to live and
   let live, as rightly envisaged by the architects of the nation and its
   Constitution. Modi's 2014 electoral campaign has left a trail of
   intolerances, directed against choices in food/dress/caste/ and class.
   Draconian laws, violence and murders have been used to stifle cultural
   and intellectual resistances. On the whole, this alarming historical
   moment is framed as a testing ground for how far the outnumbered secular
   democrats of the various political parties and denominations will
   succeed in their struggle against odds, facing both actual and virtual
   violence, in their efforts to claim India's public sphere for the
   sustenance of nation's liberal fabric and carefully wrought communal
   rapport.}},

Title = {{Design science methodology for developing a learning object repository
   for construction}},
Booktitle = {{RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: A SELECTION OF CASE
   STUDIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{267-283}},
Abstract = {{The arrival of new technologies makes learning content out of date and
   thus often leads to reinvention of the wheel. The concept of learning
   objects is the basis for a new instructional design paradigm for
   e-learning that puts the emphasis on reuse as a key characteristic of
   learning activities. In the last decade, several efforts towards the
   standardisation of learning technology have resulted in the emergence of
   specific terminologies that are used to name and classify learning
   elements. Most of these efforts underline the importance of providing
   metadata information for content in a standardised format as a crucial
   step to reusability. Most of the current learning object repositories
   provide room for metadata, but lack a semantic model that clearly
   establishes what a learning object is and what its associated metadata
   such as pedagogy should be. The lack of semantics in learning objects
   also affects their interoperability, sharability and reusability. The
   Semantic Web-based solution facilitates the easy integration and
   identification of meaningful interrelationships, represents and uniquely
   identifies the digital resources and improves search precision. However,
   Semantic Web has not been fully applied to e-learning, particularly for
   developing and delivering reusable learning objects. Therefore, this
   research brings novelty by developing an ontology for the construction
   domain in order to share and reuse construction learning objects.
   Furthermore, it follows design science research methodology and develops
   an ontology-driven, Semantic Web-based learning object repository for
   construction by integrating pedagogical concepts within the construction
   education ontology. Results from the evaluation indicated that the
   acceptance rate of the repository is low in the academic setting.
   Therefore, strategies for the acceptance of innovation by potential
   users and communities have to be developed in order to improve the
   acceptability of the learning object repository.}},

Abstract = {{Wastes and pollution are associated with an uncoordinated urbanization
   trend. This exploratory study investigates total quality management's
   (TQM) role in smart city development. It delineates smart cities and its
   conjoined relationship with digital cities. It submits to the
   complementary relationship between TQM and quality function deployment
   (QFD) and highlights stakeholder engagement as central to smart city
   development strategy, underpinned by social theory. It distils that
   stakeholders and built environment professionals need to work
   collaboratively to maximize the benefit of smart cities as being an
   innovation value chain, leading to the use of IT-enabled platform such
   as building information modelling (BIM). This culminates in the design
   of an integrative framework with ICT (focusing on BIM) and TQM serving
   as the information architecture and the ideological premise
   respectively. It then presents the close-loop (front-end) and open-loop
   (back-end) approaches to smart city development, discusses future
   research directions and concludes with implications.}},

Abstract = {{Local vibration (LV) is innovation as a part of training method that
   helps athletes to regain the power and get ready for next training
   faster. There are many discussions about how to increase moving speed in
   cross-country skiing. Many scientists research the possibilities of
   increasing moving speed in this sport. Cycle duration in different
   moving strides along different course terrains is stated, including even
   stride cycle duration separately for the leg and arm movements. It is
   proved by many studies that moving speed depends on stride cycle
   duration. A pilot study was carried out. Two LASE specialization
   students participated in the study. The following methods were used in
   the study: videoanalysis, LV manipulations, the stating experiment and
   mathematical statistics. The videoanalysis was made with Panasonic
   digital video camera (50 Hz), and the obtained data were processed using
   a videoanalysis program. LV manipulations were done to the muscles m.
   Erector spinae, m. Latisimus dorsi, m. Deltoideus, m. Trapecius and m.
   Triceps Brachi using 100 Hz frequency and different pressure on the
   muscles. The total LV application time was 10 min. with 30 min.
   relaxation. The obtained data were processed using mathematical
   statistics. The results: having stated the result difference before LV
   and after it. The results testify significant improvement of diagonal
   stride results, what is showed by the difference of the mean results.
   The results: having stated the result difference before LV and after it,
   it was stated that the mean moving speed of both students (S1 and S2) in
   the cycle before LV was 4.14m/s (S1) and 3.97m/s (S2), but after the
   application of LV the mean moving speed in a cycle was 4.51m/s (SI) and
   4.25m/s (S2), thus the difference of the means was 0.37m/s (SI) and
   0.28m/s (S2).}},

Abstract = {{Twenty years after the initial wave of national and international
   activity outlining the role of copyright within the world's first
   digital communications policy, the contours of a few fundamental policy
   principles at the intersection of copyright law and Internet regulation
   have begun to take shape. This paper focusses its attention on the
   continuing development of one such principle: The premise that
   legislatively mandated limitations on internet intermediary liability
   with regard to third party acts of copyright infringement (so-called
   safe harbors) are required to promote investment and innovation in
   Internet-related infrastructure and technology in order to achieve the
   goal of a robust public information environment.
   In the early days of the Internet, internet intermediaries argued that
   without certain limitations on their liability, little-to-no investment
   in the nascent information infrastructure would occur, i.e. there would
   be no market creation. Rightholders consistently countered this
   contention by arguing that, in the absence of adequate protection, they
   would not place their works online, i.e. there would be no goods on the
   market. Safe harbors were seen as a mechanism for ensuring right holder
   safety in the online environment without discouraging rapid market
   creation or hindering the democratic potential of the Internet. For the
   initial phase of the digital era, this compromise worked rather well.
   This paper demonstrates that, while consensus may be found regarding the
   basic premise of this precept and perhaps even with regard to specific
   aspects of its implementation, there is certainly nothing approaching
   universal understanding on how to best effectuate the policy goal. The
   reasons for this disagreement are manifold and rather comprehensible.
   The rapidly evolving technological landscape, the differing national and
   regional approaches to the regulation of the Internet, and the diverse
   legal and cultural environments all combine to make arrival at a
   globally appropriate safe harbor regime very challenging.
   Recognizing the obstacles to harmonization in this field is particularly
   relevant considering the ongoing attempts of the US to convince its
   trade partners to adopt a safe harbor framework largely equivalent to,
   and in certain respects likely narrower than, that which is laid out in
   the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA-plus). This paper argues that
   while harmonization may seem attractive given the international nature
   and overall importance of the Internet, standardization based upon an
   intricate and outdated internet safe harbor regime originally tailored
   to fit the needs of US industry is suboptimally configured for the
   digital communications policy requirements of the entire world.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the distributed monitoring of harmonic and
   interharmonic pollution in electrical power delivery systems. In order
   to measure the disturbances and to identify the sources in a wide grid,
   a distributed measurement system with hundreds of measurement nodes has
   to be adopted. With the aim of obtaining the reduction of realization
   costs, the authors propose an innovative distributed architecture, based
   on cost-effective nodes, that takes advantage from the compressive
   sampling strategy. Differently from traditional approach, the network
   nodes will be only mandated to acquire and to digitize the line voltage
   directly in a compressed form, whereas a central measurement unit will
   receive data from all nodes deployed in the grid and will perform the
   successive signal reconstruction, making possible the use of
   low-performance hardware to realize them. The assessment of the
   compliance of the proposed measurement technique with the current power
   quality standards turns out to be mandatory, thus verifying the absence
   of artifacts introduced by the adopted compressed sampling approach. (C)

Abstract = {{The Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY) player is an assistive
   reading tool developed for use by persons with visual impairments.
   Certain problems have persisted in the operating procedure and interface
   of DAISY players, especially for their Chinese users. Therefore, the aim
   of this study was to redesign the DAISY player with increased usability
   features for use by native Chinese speakers. First, a User Centered
   Design (UCD) process was employed to analyze the development of the
   prototype. Next, operation procedures were reorganized according to GOMS
   (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) methodology. Then the
   user interface was redesigned according to specific Universal Design
   (UD) principles. Following these revisions, an experiment involving four
   scenarios was conducted to compare the new prototype to other players,
   and it was tested by twelve visually impaired participants. Results
   indicate the prototype had the quickest operating times, the fewest
   number of operating errors, and the lowest mental workloads of all the
   compared players, significantly enhancing the prototypes usability.
   These findings have allowed us to generate suggestions for developing
   the next generation of DAISY players for people, especially for Chinese
   audience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights

   information of the character, hierarchical and assembly relationship of
   assembly model are discussed. And the expression method of component
   information model and storage model are established. The relationship of
   the components should content not only the assembly information but also
   the function information in order to help the designers for problem
   solving. The mapping library for assembly relationship and function
   relationship is founded in order to support the component analysis.
   Knowledge model of the component is realized by object-oriented method.
   As an example, the function relationship of a tug-of-war robot is gotten
   based on the assembly model of it in Solidworks. The efficiency of the
   knowledge model for the inventive problem solving is illustrated.}},

Title = {{Academic leagues: a Brazilian way to teach about cancer in medical
   universities}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Performance of qualified professionals committed to cancer
   care on a global scale is critical. Nevertheless there is a deficit in
   Cancer Education in Brazilian medical schools (MS). Projects called
   Academic Leagues (AL) have been gaining attention. However, there are
   few studies on this subject. AL arise from student initiative, arranged
   into different areas, on focus in general knowledge, universal to any
   medical field. They are not obligatory and students are responsible for
   the organizing and planning processes of AL, so participation highlights
   the motivation to active pursuit of knowledge. The objective of this
   study was to explore the relevance of AL, especially on the development
   of important skills and attitudes for medical students.
   Methods: A survey was undertaken in order to assess the number of AL
   Brazilian MS. After nominal list, a grey literature review was conducted
   to identify those with AL and those with Oncology AL.
   Results: One hundred eighty of the 234 MS were included. Only 4 MS
   selected held no information about AL and 74.4 \% of them had AL in
   Oncology. The majority had records in digital media. The number of AL
   was proportional to the distribution of MS across the country, which was
   related to the number of inhabitants.
   Conclusions: The real impact and the potential of these projects can be
   truly understand by a qualitative analysis. AL are able to develop
   skills and competencies that are rarely stimulated whilst studying in
   traditional curriculum. This has positive effects on professional
   training, community approach through prevention strategies, and
   development on a personal level permitting a dynamic, versatile and
   attentive outlook to their social role. Besides stimulating fundamental
   roles to medical practice, students that participate in AL acquire
   knowledge and develop important skills such as management and
   leadership, entrepreneurship, innovation, health education, construction
   of citizenship. Oncology AL encourage more skilled care to patients and
   more effective policies for cancer control.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the evolution of divergent developmental
   trajectories requires detailed comparisons of embryologies at
   appropriate levels. Cell lineages, the accurate visualization of
   cleavage patterns, tissue fate restrictions, and morphogenetic movements
   that occur during the development of individual embryos are currently
   available for few disparate animal taxa, encumbering evolutionarily
   meaningful comparisons. Tunicates, considered to be close relatives of
   vertebrates, are marine invertebrates whose fossil record dates back to
   525 million years ago. Life-history strategies across this subphylum are
   radically different, and include biphasic ascidians with free swimming
   larvae and a sessile adult stage, and the holoplanktonic larvaceans.
   Despite considerable progress, notably on the molecular level, the exact
   extent of evolutionary conservation and innovation during embryology
   remain obscure.
   Results: Here, using the innovative technique of bifocal 4D-microscopy,
   we demonstrate exactly which characteristics in the cell lineages of the
   ascidian Phallusia mammillata and the larvacean Oikopleura dioica were
   conserved and which were altered during evolution. Our accurate cell
   lineage trees in combination with detailed three-dimensional
   representations clearly identify conserved correspondence in relative
   cell position, cell identity, and fate restriction in several lines from
   all prospective larval tissues. At the same time, we precisely pinpoint
   differences observable at all levels of development. These differences
   comprise fate restrictions, tissue types, complex morphogenetic movement
   patterns, numerous cases of heterochronous acceleration in the larvacean
   embryo, and differences in bilateral symmetry.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate in extraordinary detail the
   multitude of developmental levels amenable to evolutionary innovation,
   including subtle changes in the timing of fate restrictions as well as
   dramatic alterations in complex morphogenetic movements. We anticipate
   that the precise spatial and temporal cell lineage data will moreover
   serve as a high-precision guide to devise experimental investigations of
   other levels, such as molecular interactions between cells or changes in
   gene expression underlying the documented structural evolutionary
   changes. Finally, the quantitative amount of digital high-precision
   morphological data will enable and necessitate software-based similarity
   assessments as the basis of homology hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate whether language used in science abstracts can
   skew towards the use of strikingly positive and negative words over
   time.
   Design Retrospective analysis of all scientific abstracts in PubMed
   between 1974 and 2014.
   Methods The yearly frequencies of positive, negative, and neutral words
   (25 preselected words in each category), plus 100 randomly selected
   words were normalised for the total number of abstracts. Subanalyses
   included pattern quantification of individual words, specificity for
   selected high impact journals, and comparison between author
   affiliations within or outside countries with English as the official
   majority language. Frequency patterns were compared with 4\% of all
   books ever printed and digitised by use of Google Books Ngram Viewer.
   Main outcome measures Frequencies of positive and negative words in
   abstracts compared with frequencies of words with a neutral and random
   connotation, expressed as relative change since 1980.
   Results The absolute frequency of positive words increased from 2.0\%
   (1974-80) to 17.5\% (2014), a relative increase of 880\% over four
   decades. All 25 individual positive words contributed to the increase,
   particularly the words ``robust,{''} ``novel,{''} ``innovative,{''} and
   ``unprecedented,{''} which increased in relative frequency up to 15
   000\%. Comparable but less pronounced results were obtained when
   restricting the analysis to selected journals with high impact factors.
   Authors affiliated to an institute in a non-English speaking country
   used significantly more positive words. Negative word frequencies
   increased from 1.3\% (1974-80) to 3.2\% (2014), a relative increase of
   257\%. Over the same time period, no apparent increase was found in
   neutral or random word use, or in the frequency of positive word use in
   published books.
   Conclusions Our lexicographic analysis indicates that scientific
   abstracts are currently written with more positive and negative words,
   and provides an insight into the evolution of scientific writing.
   Apparently scientists look on the bright side of research results. But
   whether this perception fits reality should be questioned.}},

Title = {{Translating group programmes into online formats: establishing the
   acceptability of a parents' sex and relationships communication serious
   game}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: With ongoing concerns about the sexual health and wellbeing
   of young people, there is increasing need to innovate intervention
   approaches. Engaging parents as agents to support their children,
   alongside capitalising on increasingly sophisticated technological
   options could jointly enhance support. Converting existing programmes
   into interactive game based options has the potential to broaden
   learning access whilst preserving behaviour change technique fidelity.
   However the acceptability of this approach and viability of adapting
   resources in this way is yet to be established. This paper reports on
   the process of converting an existing group programme ({''}What Should
   We Tell the Children?{''}) and tests the acceptability within a
   community setting.
   Methods: Translation of the original programme included selecting
   exercises and gathering user feedback on character and message framing
   preferences. For acceptability testing, parents were randomised to
   either the game (n = 106) or a control (non-interactive webpage)
   condition (n = 76). At time 1 all participants completed a survey on
   demographics, computer literacy and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)
   items. Post intervention (time 2) users repeated the TPB questions in
   addition to acceptability items. Interviews (n = 17) were conducted 3
   months post intervention to gather qualitative feedback on transfer of
   learning into real life.
   Results: The process of conversion identified clear preferences for
   first person role play, home setting and realistic characters alongside
   positively phrased feedback. Evaluation results show that the game was
   acceptable to parents on cognitive and emotional dimensions,
   particularly for parents of younger children. Acceptability was not
   influenced by baseline demographics, computer skills or baseline TPB
   variables. MANOVA analysis and qualitative feedback suggest potential
   for effective translation of learning into real life. However attrition
   was more likely in the game condition, potentially due to feedback text
   volume.
   Conclusions: A manualised group programme can be viably converted into a
   serious game format which is both cognitively and emotionally
   acceptable. The intervention may be more effectively targeted at parents
   with younger children, and further game developments must particularly
   address information dosing. Establishing the viability of digitally
   converting a group programme is a significant step forward for
   implementation focused research.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a proliferative fibromatosis
   of the hand, which causes permanent flexion contracture of the digits
   and, ultimately, loss of function. The treatment of DD is complex and
   involves surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the goal of removing
   the affected tissue. New biological targets are under investigation in
   order to develop innovative therapies.Areas covered: The etiology of DD
   is still unknown. Several authors who focused their studies on the
   genetics of DD recognized an inherited autosomal dominant pattern.
   Actually, DD is a multifactorial and complex disease. Myofibroblasts are
   thought to play a crucial role in its pathogenesis, although their
   origin is not clear.Expert opinion: There is a general consensus that a
   better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of DD will
   lead to the design of more specific and effective treatment
   alternatives. In this review, the authors hypothesize a new biological
   model for DD pathology, where myofibroblasts enhance the reservoir of
   the disease acting as if in a vicious cycle. This could help,
   ultimately, in identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat this
   common and disabling fibroproliferative disorder.}},

Abstract = {{In June 2014 an Expert Panel on Technology and Innovation in UN
   Peacekeeping was commissioned to examine how technology and innovation
   could strengthen peacekeeping missions. The panel's report argues for
   wider deployment of advanced technologies, including greater use of
   ground and airborne sensors and other technical sources of data,
   advanced data analytics and information fusion to assist in data
   integration. This article explores the emerging intelligence-led,
   informationist conception of UN peacekeeping against the backdrop of
   increasingly complex peacekeeping mandates and precarious security
   conditions. New peacekeeping with its heightened commitment to
   information as a political resource and the endorsement of offensive
   military action within robust mandates reflects the multiple and
   conflicting trajectories generated by asymmetric conflicts, the
   responsibility to protect and a technology-driven information
   revolution. We argue that the idea of peacekeeping is being revised (and
   has been revised) by realities beyond peacekeeping itself that require
   rethinking the morality of peacekeeping in light of the emergence of
   `digital peacekeeping' and the knowledge revolution engendered by new
   technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The possession and access to relevant information, as well as to the
   newly created knowledge, became the main asset within knowledge-based
   economies, and, hence, societies. In order to achieve considerable level
   of innovation and competitiveness in the modern labor market, companies
   are striving to manage knowledge they dispose with in the most optimal
   way. One of the basic preconditions for accomplishing this goal is to
   employ highly skilled knowledge workers. Given that this is the
   workforce of the future, all levels of education, particularly
   institutions at the university level, must adapt their curricula in
   order to form professionals capable of anticipating and solving problems
   within the business environment. Considering that these professionals
   must remain experts in their scientific fields during their entire
   career, the concept of lifelong learning especially applies to them.
   Hence, universities must pay particular attention not only to educating
   future knowledge workers, but also to providing constant additional
   training, primarily through digital means and distance type of learning.
   Knowledge workers are encouraged to use digital tools and methods as
   much as possible for the purpose of their professional development. In
   order to achieve and maintain a high level of competitiveness in the
   ever-changing labor market, these experts are also required to stay
   constantly and adequately informed, which they mostly accomplish by
   means of digital media. Therefore, it became obvious that when educating
   future knowledge workers universities have to implement ICT to a much
   greater extent. Digital tools should also be utilized at the university
   level in order to incite a higher level of creativity of university
   students, as this is one of the essential features of knowledge
   professionals. Encouraging inventiveness at the university level is
   particularly important so that future knowledge workers can acquire the
   habit of transferring theoretical knowledge in an original manner into
   new applicable knowledge. Within this paper, we will offer a review of
   current knowledge workers. education at the university level and
   possible innovations in this regard, particularly with the application
   of digital tools in lifelong education and training of future workforce
   based on knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Many molecular mechanisms in complex biological processes of diseases
   cannot be fully understood without direct visualization. In the last
   decades, advances in imaging principles and technologies have expanded
   our ability to capture and analyze the morphology of tissues and cells'
   components on conventional widefield optical and fluorescence
   microscopies and their derivatives confocal and multiphoton fluorescence
   laser-scanning microscopes, as well as transmission electron
   microscopes. Innovative imaging technologies are now emerging for
   constructing fine structural features, precise localization and the
   dynamic interplay of single and macromolecular assemblies that drive
   cell growth, differentiation and cell death as well as stromal and
   chromatin remodeling within many cellular context. The newer
   super-resolution microscopies capture images with unprecedented
   sensitivity and clarity allowing the exploration of interactions between
   individual molecules with a distance resolution as low as 20 nm. But
   these techniques are not robust enough to quantitate molecules on a
   genome-wide scale. Mass spectrometry imaging is a high-throughput
   chemical imaging technique for the identification, quantitation and
   distribution of proteins, lipids and chemical metabolites at picomol
   level within a single-cell and complex multicellular tissue. Here we
   provide an overview on imaging instrumentations and computational
   platforms to store, data mining, analyze and retrieving genomic,
   proteomic and immunohistochemistry digital image information which are
   available for multilevel academic-private collaborations. The expansion
   of these data sets will lead to a merge picture from it we will retrieve
   knowledge for more rational-design systems to basic and clinical
   research in near future.}},

   profiles to identify how digital media are used in setting the agendas
   for discussions and in organizing and mobilizing people about social,
   political and cultural topics like ethnic, racial, gender, and citizens'
   rights issues in Sao Paulo city. This platform was chosen because of its
   growing appropriation for political actions. The study found that the
   incorporation of digital tools in political action is bringing about a
   number of changes in the discussion of social, political, and cultural
   topics, and redefining the ways that agendas and deliberations are
   organized, fostering innovative forms of participation by social actors.}},

Abstract = {{Inequality is a concept which always has concerned sociologists.
   Sociology has been studying inequality from different areas: cultural,
   educational, economic, etc. In this research that we introduce here, we
   want to take an innovative and updated step forward, analyzing digital
   inequality through which it is called ``Digital divide{''}. Therefore,
   we have chosen to use a quantitative methodology delimiting it to a
   specific period, 2010-2014. Specifically, the last claim in this
   research is to show the link between academic background and the use of
   Technologies. We move into differentiate the user-level of ICTs and, the
   use of ICTs with impact in improving the quality of life of citizens
   and, thus, to equate citizenship avoiding this way an insurmountable
   social ``cleavage{''} between digitized citizen and non-digitized
   citizen. Finally, to point out that the territorial space we have picked
   out to our analysis is (Autonomous community of) Andalusia, where this
   new realities of digital inequalities set out new imbalances, the called
   second Digital Divide and Gender Digital Divide.}},

Abstract = {{The creators of today's most successful technologies share an important
   willingness to push the envelope a drive that propels digital industry
   forward. This same drive, however, can lead some technology purveyors to
   push the limits of legality or even become scofflaws in their pursuit of
   innovation or (more often) profit. The United States must figure out how
   to harness the important creative force at the heart of the hacker ethic
   while still deterring destructive criminal wrongdoers. Because it is
   often courts that must answer this question, it is essential to examine
   the legal doctrines prosecutors use to sweep up technology providers.
   This Article focuses on one type of criminal liability accomplice
   liability that can act as a dragnet on providers of technology that
   lends itself to criminal use. In particular, a violation of the federal
   statute for aiding and abetting, 18 U.S.C. 2, can be implied in every
   charge for a federal substantive offense, and there is a potentially
   troubling strain of cases holding that knowing assistance can be enough
   to deem someone an aider and abettor, even without stronger evidence of
   a shared criminal purpose.
   This Article examines when the proprietors of technology with criminal
   uses aid and abet their users' crimes. The aim is to help courts,
   prosecutors, and technologists draw the line between joining a criminal
   enterprise and merely providing technology with criminal uses. This
   Article explains the legal doctrines underlying this type of liability
   and provides examples of at-risk technologies, including spam software,
   file-sharing services, and anonymity networks like Tor. Ultimately, this
   Article concludes that the web of superficially conflicting rulings on
   the required mental state for aiding and abetting are best harmonized
   and future rulings on liability for new technologies are best predicted
   by looking to the existence of ``substantial unoffending uses{''} for
   the product or service provided by the accused technologist.}},

Abstract = {{DIVE is a linked-data digital cultural heritage collection browser. It
   was developed to provide innovative access to heritage objects from
   heterogeneous collections, using historical events and narratives as the
   context for searching, browsing and presenting of individual and group
   of objects. This paper describes the DIVE Web Demonstrator.(1) We also
   discuss how the collection metadata the demonstrator uses are enriched
   through a hybrid workflow. The demonstrator uses semantics from these
   enriched collections, their vocabularies and linked data vocabularies to
   establish connections between the collection media objects and the

Abstract = {{Objective: Analyze the teacher identity formation process from the
   perspective of the past, present and future in the training of nursing
   teachers through the integration of digital technologies. Method:
   Descriptive, exploratory study, with a qualitative approach, conducted
   in the on-site class ``Teacher Identity Formation{''} in 2012. Of the
   synchronous and asynchronous activities, four were analyzed using
   content analysis. Results: In chat, positive and negative impressions
   and reflections on the formation of one's own identity were identified
   (six categories); in the ``Time tunnel,{''} the projection of future
   identity (four categories); in the ``Portfolio,{''} the perception of
   one's own identity (four categories); and in the evaluation of the
   class, the perception of the experiences lived in the class (two
   categories). Conclusion: The integration of digital technologies
   promoted, in a collaborative way, discussion and understanding by
   students of how their identity is formed and the projection of their
   future identity, aligned with the profile and role of teachers demanded
   in the world of today.}},

   dolomitization (Vajont Limestone, Southern Alps, Italy)}},

Abstract = {{Different remote sensing technologies, including photogrammetry and
   LIDAR (light detection and ranging), allow collecting three-dimensional
   (3D) data sets that can be used to create 3D digital representations of
   outcrop surfaces, called digital outcrop models (DOM). The main
   advantages of photogrammetry over LIDAR are represented by the very
   simple and lightweight field equipment (a digital camera), and by the
   arbitrary spatial resolution, that can be increased simply getting
   closer to the outcrop or by using a different lens. The quality of
   photogrammetric data sets obtained with structure from motion (SFM)
   techniques has shown a tremendous improvement over the past few years,
   and this is becoming one of the more effective ways to collect DOM data
   sets. The Vajont Gorge (Belluno Dolomites, Italy) provides spectacular
   outcrops of jurassic limestones (Vajont Limestone Formation) in which
   mesozoic faults and fracture corridors are continuously exposed. Some of
   these faults acted as conduits for fluids, resulting in structurally
   controlled dolomitization. A 3D DOM study, based on a photogrammetric
   SFM data set, was carried out, aimed at enabling interdisciplinary
   characterization and reconstruction of coupled brittle deformation and
   fluid flow processes. For this study we used a DOM (730 m x 360 m x 270
   m) consisting of continuous triangulated surfaces representing the
   outcrop, textured with high-resolution images. Interpretation and
   modeling performed on this data set include (1) georeferencing of
   structural measurements and sampling stations; (2) tracing of
   stratigraphic boundaries, structural surfaces, and dolomitization fronts
   (ground-truthed); (3) correlation and extrapolation of realistic 3D
   surfaces from these traces; and (4) development of a 3D geological model
   at the scale of the Vajont Gorge, including stratigraphy, faults,
   dolomitization fronts, and volumetric meshes suitable for the
   statistical analysis of structural, diagenetic, and geochemical
   parameters. The DOM study highlighted the close relationship between
   faults and dolostone geobodies, demonstrating that dolomitization was
   guided by fluid infiltration along Mesozoic normal faults. In order to
   explore the uncertainty associated with the 3D model of irregularly
   shaped dolostone bodies, three different 3D dolostone geobody
   realizations have been modeled, providing a minimum, intermediate, and
   maximum estimate of the dolostone/limestone volumetric facies ratio,
   while honoring the field constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Equal access has serious implications for the growing chasm in learning
   in remote areas and in economically disadvantaged communities. To help
   bridge the digital divide for children in remote areas, engaging
   communities to provide the needed resources in remote schools is
   essential. With an aim to promoting teachers' adaptation of tablet
   reading and teaching among remote schools, a platform for sharing
   experiences and exchanging ideas among teachers was developed. College
   students also volunteered for follow-up mobile reading promotion in
   order to provide needed human resources for tablet reading integration
   among disadvantaged communities. Collaborative efforts by the university
   and teachers in remote schools provided a case for study. The main
   issues explored in this study were: (1) how teachers in remote areas
   adapted tablet reading in the classroom, and (2) what university
   students experienced from promoting tablet reading. This paper presents
   a qualitative analysis of integrating volunteer services and civic
   engagement in promoting tablet reading, and highlights the mutual
   benefits, challenges, and recommendations for future implementation.
   Various data resources were integrated into the inductive analysis, and
   different resources were used for triangulating the reported phenomena.
   The study concludes that the teachers obtained experience of tablet
   reading, and the college students experienced innovative
   volunteer-service opportunities. The collaboration among the society,
   the university, and learning sites were all essential for promoting
   tablet reading among children in remote areas.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) at the point of
   care are evidence-based interventions that have demonstrated incremental
   positive impact on quality of healthcare delivery over the past two
   decades. Existing best practices inform strategies to promote adoption
   and achievement of targeted outcomes. The purpose of this improvement
   project was to conduct a pilot implementation to understand the
   contextual factors and readiness for dissemination of a newly acquired
   electronic CDSS by evaluating its influence on diagnostic accuracy in
   nurse practitioners (NPs) functioning in a community health setting.
   Aims: The specific aims of this project were to measure and compare
   diagnostic accuracy in a pilot group before and after CDSS use, educate
   clinicians about the system and pilot its use, and then leverage the
   experience to design the practice-wide CDSS dissemination strategy.
   Methods: The project engaged a subset of NPs from a home-based primary
   care practice and other organizational stakeholders who provided
   tangible support and necessary resources for successful adoption of this
   innovation in practice. A structured conceptual model of Evidence-Based
   Practice Improvement enhanced with elements of the Promoting Action on
   Research Implementation in Health Sciences framework was used to guide
   the development, implementation and evaluation of this practice
   improvement initiative. A group of seven NP representatives of the
   practice participated in the project. Data collection was composed of
   small tests of change (plan-do-study-act) cycles at the local practice
   level, measuring achievement of improvement of the chosen outcome of
   correctness of medical diagnosis evidenced by appropriate substantiating
   clinical documentation.
   Linking evidence to action: In this home visiting primary care practice
   setting, use of a CDSS by NPs achieved eventual improvement in
   diagnostic accuracy and clinical documentation, as demonstrated on chart
   audit, though the improvement was not sustained over time. The pilot
   findings ultimately informed decision making about CDSS dissemination
   strategies and future uses of the system. When appropriately deployed, a
   CDSS offers the potential to improve professional practice, support
   differential diagnosis and evidence-based treatment, and provide
   detailed information about the disease state to facilitate robust
   clinical documentation.}},

Abstract = {{The buzz surrounding Bitcoin has reached a fever pitch. Yet in academic
   legal discussions, disproportionate emphasis is placed on bitcoins (that
   is, virtual currency), and little mention is made of blockchain
   technology the true innovation behind the Bitcoin protocol. Simply,
   blockchain technology solves an elusive networking problem by enabling
   ``trustless{''} transactions: value exchanges over computer networks
   that can be verified, monitored, and enforced without central
   institutions (for example, banks). This has broad implications for how
   we transact over electronic networks.
   This Note integrates current research from leading computer scientists
   and cryptographers to elevate the legal community's understanding of
   blockchain technology and, ultimately, to inform policymakers and
   practitioners as they consider different regulatory schemes. An
   examination of the economic properties of a blockchain-based currency
   suggests the technology's true value lies in its potential to facilitate
   more efficient digital-asset transfers. For example, applications of
   special interest to the legal community include more efficient document
   and authorship verification, title transfers, and contract enforcement.
   Though a regulatory patchwork around virtual currencies has begun to
   form, its careful analysis reveals much uncertainty with respect to
   these alternative applications.
   The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, soil erosion was mapped in Ishmi-Erzeni watershed,
   Albania, using the G2 model. The G2 model has been proposed as an
   agri-environmental service by the Global Monitoring for Environment and
   Security (GMES) initiative (now Copernicus programme). Based on the
   principles of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), G2 provides maps
   of actual soil loss at a monthly time-step. The main innovations of the
   model with regard to previous USLE family models are as follows: the
   introduction of a `storm factor', which differentiates rainfall
   erosivity (R factor) per month when detailed rain intensity records are
   not available; the use of standardised biophysical parameters derived
   from satellite image time series in combination with land use
   information for calculating the vegetation retention factor (denoted
   here as V factor, corresponding to C factor of USLE); and the use of
   satellite imagery for calculating a new factor, namely the slope
   intercept factor (denoted as I factor), which expresses landscape
   feature alterations, thus functioning as corrective to the topographic
   influence factor (denoted here as T factor, the slope length and
   steepness (LS) factor of USLE). The model was originally implemented in
   the cross-border Strymonas river basin and on the island of Crete after
   revision; in both cases with encouraging results. The G2 model follows a
   data-driven methodology, while providing alternatives for all factor
   estimations with moderate data requirements. For the model application
   in the Ishmi-Erzeni watershed (covering 2200 km(2)), rainfall data were
   collected from ten weather stations, and soil properties were measured
   from sampling at 47 locations. Vegetation layers were downloaded from
   the GMES portal, while land use information was extracted from a
   Landsat-7 TM image. Finally, terrain properties were calculated from a
   250-m digital elevation model (DEM) of the area. The G2 model showed
   Ishmi-Erzeni to have moderate soil erosion, with a mean annual soil loss
   estimated to be 6.5 t/ha; however, 18 \% of the area is facing an annual
   risk of soil removal more than 10 t/ ha, which is considered to be a
   sustainable threshold for Albania. Winter months appear to be the most
   risky, with all months contributing substantially to the annual erosion
   rate (i.e. between 4 and 12 \% each). Areas of coniferous and mixed
   forests, together with mountainous agricultural land, appear to be the
   most risky land uses. In conclusion, the G2 model proved to be useful
   and efficient for predicting erosion at monthly time-steps for all land
   uses in the Ishmi-Erzeni watershed. Future research will focus on an
   Albania-wide erosion mapping task, using the G2 model.}},

Abstract = {{Comparison of bony pieces requires that they are oriented systematically
   to ensure that homologous regions are compared. Few orientation methods
   are highly accurate; this is particularly true for methods applied to
   three-dimensional models obtained by surface scanning, a technique whose
   special features make it a powerful tool in forensic contexts.
   The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a systematic, assisted
   orientation method for aligning three-dimensional cranial models
   relative to the Frankfurt Plane, which would be produce accurate
   orientations independent of operator and anthropological expertise.
   The study sample comprised four crania of known age and sex. All the
   crania were scanned and reconstructed using an Eva Artec (TM) portable
   3D surface scanner and subsequently, the position of certain
   characteristic landmarks were determined by three different operators
   using the Rhinoceros 3D surface modelling software. Intra-observer
   analysis showed a tendency for orientation to be more accurate when
   using the assisted method than when using conventional manual
   orientation.
   Inter-observer analysis showed that experienced evaluators achieve
   results at least as accurate if not more accurate using the assisted
   method than those obtained using manual orientation; while inexperienced
   evaluators achieved more accurate orientation using the assisted method.
   The method tested is a an innovative system capable of providing very
   precise, systematic and automatised spatial orientations of virtual
   cranial models relative to standardised anatomical planes independent of
   the operator and operator experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Tremor is an involuntary, oscillating, debilitating movement which
   affects over 50\% of people with Multiple Sclerosis. In this paper an
   advanced paradigm, combining linearising action and repetitive control
   (RC), is developed to suppress tremor using functional electrical
   stimulation (FES) applied to wrist extensors/flexors. This innovative
   biomechanical approach to tremor suppression embeds learning from
   experience, and its effectiveness is confirmed in tests performed with
   nine healthy adults who attended a single one-hour session. Using FES,
   pathological wrist tremors (2.5, 3 or 4 Hz) were induced via extensor
   digitorum and a validated mechanical wrist-rig was used to collect data.
   Results confirmed statistically significant reduction in pathological
   movement, measured by path-length wrist movement and single peak
   amplitude of tremor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Enacting a critical environmental education curriculum theory with 8- to
   9-year-old children in 1978 is now restoried' in a history of the
   present/future' like case study' for prosecuting five interrelated
   problems confronting progress in environmental education and its
   research. They are: the intense heat of the Anthropocene; the
   accelerating speed of the Dromosphere; the deep cuts of neoliberalism's
   policing of the cognitive capitalism of the corporate university and
   public education; the entrepreneurial entry of sustainababble into the
   discourse of education; and the digital colonisation of its pedagogical
   practices. The once radical promise of environmental education to serve
   as a critique of education partially through its language' (Le Grange,
   2013) of empowerment, agency, transformation, contestation, ideology,
   ethics, action, praxis and change demands revitalisation; hence, this
   belated restorying of the 1978 case. The time is right; at least in some
   academic/educational settings where the new materialism' notions of
   critical, agency and action remain much more than a fading memory or
   convenient text. New theory helps restory this old curriculum theory and
   its slow ecopedagogical activism. In this old', the critical curriculum
   theory (re)positioned young children and their teacher as action
   researchers of their own embodied socio-environmental relations. Through
   highly inclusive and participatory practices of outdoor and indoor
   ecopedagogy, children became ethically active citizens', capable of
   democratically enacting political and Political change. This active
   responsibility for the environment' was, indeed, a key purpose, or
   promise, of environmental education when the field was formalised in the
   1970s. Elements of children's (eco)aesthetics-environmental ethics and
   ecopolitics are described in this case account of the environmental
   design' of a radical curriculum innovation that critically emphasised
   the humanly-constructive' educational conditions that enable agency
   (Payne, 1995, 1999a). Such enablements were only ever assumed in the
   socially critical' theorisations of curriculum and pedagogy developed in
   Australia in the early 1980s. For researchers, this partially
   autoethnographic narrating of the old case describes the children's
   (embodied) experiences and locally emplaced agencies in newer
   theoretical figurations' of their bodytimespace' relationalities.
   Children's outdoor expeditions', interdisciplinary inquiries, literacy
   development, scientific investigations, and personal and public
   activisms are described. Revealing these micro figurational
   relationalities in slow ecopedagogical contexts of the environmental
   design of education (Payne, 2014) is consistent with Robottom and Hart's
   (1993) too often forgotten old' call for researchers and practitioners
   to clarify the presuppositions they make about the trilogy of
   ontology-epistemology and methodology in framing, conceptualising,
   contextualising, representing, and legitimating the research problem and
   its questions. This restorying and history of the present/future is
   alert to (but cannot develop) aspects of contemporary high' theory drawn
   from the humanities, social sciences and arts that prioritises the
   politics of ontological deliberation and the ecologies of things,
   (re)claims a material disposition in empirical inquiry and critique
   while speculating about non-anthropocentric thought' responsive to the
   new' rallying point of, for example, the Anthropocene.
   In sum, new theory helps restory the critical, creative, expressive and
   experimental forms of re-theorising the persistent problematic of human
   and non-human nature relations and the role of education well on display
   in this old.' This revitalised history of the present/future aims to
   revive critical optimism and imagination about how agencies of
   socio-environmental change once promised by critical environmental
   education and its research can be returned'. The article concludes with
   some post-critical retheorising of key critical components of the 1978
   curriculum theory.}},

Title = {{Performing the sharing economy}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The sharing economy converges around activities facilitated through
   digital platforms that enable peer-to-peer access to goods and services.
   It constitutes an apparent paradox, framed as both part of the
   capitalist economy and as an alternative. This duplicity necessitates
   focusing on the performances of the sharing economy: how it
   simultaneously constructs diverse economic activities whilst also
   inviting the deconstruction of ongoing practices of dominance. Such
   performances hold open the question of what the (sharing) economy is,
   suspending it as a space for both opportunity and critique. Drawing on
   participant observation at a sharing economy `festival' and analysis of
   the vocabularies of online platforms, the paper outlines three
   performances of sharing through community, access and collaboration. It
   argues through these performances that the sharing economy is contingent
   and complexly articulated. It has the potential to both shake up and
   further entrench `business-as-usual' through the ongoing reconfiguration
   of a divergent range of (economic) activities. Whilst offering an
   antidote to the narrative of economy as engendering isolation and
   separation, the sharing economy simultaneously masks new forms of
   inequality and polarisations of ownership. Nonetheless, the paper
   concludes in suggesting that by pointing to wider questions concerning
   participation in, access to and production of resources, the sharing
   economy should not be dismissed. Instead, it should serve as prompt to
   engage with `digital' transformations of economy in the spirit of
   affirmative critique that might enact the promise of doing economy
   differently. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An evidence centered design approach was used to develop, implement, and
   assess a novel and innovative digital pipetting badge using Purdue's
   Passport system. Each student in a large lecture course created a video
   demonstrating how to use a 10 mL pipet to dispense liquid. The video was
   uploaded into the Passport system, which allowed instructors to give
   each student feedback on their pipetting technique and to either accept
   or deny the video. Students who had denied videos were able to use the
   feedback to improve their technique, reshoot the video, and upload it
   again for grading. Student perceptions of their knowledge, confidence,
   and experience pipetting were collected before and after the laboratory
   where the videos were created. Analysis demonstrated significant
   differences in student perceptions and large effect sizes. Over 90\% of
   students correctly answered a multiple-choice item on the first exam and
   the final pertaining to the process of pipetting. The digital pipetting
   badge significantly and positively impacted classroom practices wherein
   the students learned to pipet more effectively and improved their
   knowledge, confidence, and experience in pipetting.}},

Abstract = {{Impact sourcing - the practice of bringing digitally-enabled outsourcing
   jobs to marginalized individuals - is an important emerging social
   innovation in the outsourcing industry. The impact sourcing model of
   delivering Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing
   (IT-BPO) services not only seeks to deliver business value for clients,
   but is also driven by an explicit social mission to help marginalized
   communities enjoy the benefits of globalization. This dual focus has led
   to the ambitious claim that social value creation can be integral to
   (and not always by-products of) innovative IT-BPO models. Given the
   relative newness of the impact sourcing business model there is scarce
   research about how impact sourcing companies emerge and the process
   through which entrepreneurs build and operate such companies. This paper
   draws on a qualitative study of seven Indian impact sourcing companies
   and develops a process model of the individual-level motivational
   triggers of impact sourcing entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial
   actions underpinning different phases of venture creation and the
   positive institutional-level influences on impact sourcing. The paper
   argues that since deeply personalized values are central to the creation
   and development of impact sourcing companies, the business model may not
   be easy to replicate. The analysis highlights an intensive period of
   embedding and robust alliances with local partners as crucial for the
   scalability and sustainability of the impact sourcing business model. It
   also emphasizes the role of `social' encoding and mimicry in determining
   the extent to which impact sourcing companies are able to retain their
   commitment to marginalized communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a scenario planning approach that is a
   hybrid of three main schools of thought. We propose such an approach in
   order to develop scenarios for a contemporary, technology-driven and
   fast-moving industry such as Interactive Digital Media. Our approach,
   while essentially qualitative in nature, nevertheless draws from the
   rigors of quantitative methods in identifying and then tracking the
   significant Dimensions of Analysis that impact the industry. The capture
   and analysis of real-time events was automated by an off-the-shelf web
   crawler with analytic functions, thus making our approach scalable over
   a larger scope and for longer periods of time. A morphological technique
   using Multidimensional Scaling isolated strands within the events
   leading to the identification of trends. This was followed by the
   mapping of strands to three emergent themes ownership, distribution and
   innovation which were used in an expert construction exercise to
   formulate plausible scenarios. We suggest that the approach we describe
   is particularly applicable for dynamic scenario planning that requires
   revisiting key assumptions and market conditions on a regular basis. We
   conclude that the ability to develop strategic narratives is the
   overriding benefit of scenario planning rather than the purported
   ability to predict the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper aims to describe some innovative layout styles, which are
   capable to boost the electrical performance and, in the same time, the
   Total Ionizing Dose (TID) tolerance of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS)
   Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET), without burdening the current planar
   Complementary MOS (CMOS) Integrated Circuits (ICs) manufacturing
   processes. To illustrate the potential use of these new alternative
   devices in analog and digital CMOS ICs applications, this work focuses
   on the Diamond layout style for MOSFET that presents hexagonal gate
   geometry. The new effects associated to this innovative transistor
   structure and its modeling are presented and discussed in detail. Some
   experimental results are illustrated to evidence its use mainly in space
   and medical CMOS ICs applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The EU intends to complete the creation of Digital Single Market in
   2015. In order to achieve this ambitious, but rather unrealistic goal,
   serious initiatives need to be undertaken to remove barriers and
   introduce new rules reflecting the state-of-the-art of e-commerce and
   e-government. Over the last three years the EU has commenced several
   important initiatives. One of them is the newly adopted and largely
   unnoticed Regulation No 910/2014, which established unified rules across
   the EU for recognition of national electronic identification as well as
   the introduction of a variety of new trust services, which go beyond
   well-known digital signatures and timestamps. The new instrument laid
   down the foundation for the development of innovative, cross-border
   online services that will hopefully increase the security and
   transparency of information society services in the EU. A lot needs to
   be done to popularise the cross-border trust services, as the
   predecessor of the Regulation - the directive on electronic signatures -
   has not been widely adopted in public and especially, in private sector.
   Directive 1999/93/EC will be repealed with effect from 1 July 2016. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an innovative automatic road-vectorisation
   algorithm based on dynamic pixel clustering using particle swarm
   optimisation. A new cost function is designed to optimise the number and
   position of road keypoints and is capable of deriving road centrelines
   without considering geometric, spectral or topological characteristics
   in the road model. The algorithm is applied to different high-resolution
   images (IKONOS, QuickBird and aerial photographs) and is evaluated with
   respect to RMSE, correctness and completeness. Moreover, a new quality
   parameter is defined to evaluate a kinking effect in roads. Extraction
   of different road shapes with an acceptable precision in both urban and
   rural environments proves the efficiency of the algorithm in yielding
   complete road networks.}},

Abstract = {{Big data society has changed the traditional forms of data analysis and
   created a new predictive approach to knowledge and investigation. In
   this light, it is necessary to consider the impact of this new paradigm
   on the traditional notion of data protection and its regulation.
   Focussing on the individual and communal dimension of data use,
   encompassing digital investigations, the authors outline the challenges
   that big data poses for individual information self-determination,
   reasonable suspicion and collective interests. Therefore, the article
   suggests some innovative proposals that may update the existing data
   protection legal framework and contribute to make it respondent to the
   present algorithmic society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image processing, an innovative cost-effective technique, was
   employed to investigate the hydrodynamics of a rectangular internal loop
   airlift reactor with double downcomer. The whole reactor was divided
   into two downcomers and a riser by means of two vertical blades to
   achieve a new geometry. Air and water served as gas and liquid media.
   Experimental measurements were performed by visualizing the
   concentration of a colored tracer by a digital camera. The captured
   successive images at specified time intervals were analyzed by the
   ImageJ software to turn images into quantifiable data. For four reactor
   geometries, the residence time distribution curves in individual
   sections and the liquid mixing performance were determined by this
   noninvasive method. The speed of this technique to capture real-time
   data of flow patterns may be one of the most important concerns for
   imaging multiphase flows in process industries.}},

Abstract = {{The mandible is the most frequently fractured bone in maxillofacial
   trauma, the treatment of which consists of reduction and fixation of
   dislocated fragments by open or closed approach. Innovative techniques
   toward reducing the period of the postoperative intermaxillary fixation
   (IMF) are being researched. A relatively unknown treatment that may have
   an effect on fracture healing is ultrasound. Recent clinical trials have
   shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has a positive effect
   on bone healing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   LIPUS on healing by its application in fresh, minimally displaced or
   undisplaced mandibular fracture in young and healthy individuals. A
   total of 28 healthy patients were selected randomly from the outpatient
   department needing treatment of mandibular fractures. They were then
   randomly allocated to either of the following two groupsexperimental
   group and study group. After IMF, patients in experimental group
   received pulsed ultrasound signals with frequency of 1MHz, with temporal
   and spatial intensity of 1.5 W/cm(2), pulsed wave for 5 minutes on every
   alternate day for 24 days, whereas patients in control group received no
   therapy except IMF. Radiographic density at the fracture zone was
   assessed from the radiograph by Emago (Emago, Amsterdam, Netherlands)
   Image Analysis software before IMF then at 1st to 5th weeks post-IMF.
   The amount of clinical mobility between fracture fragments was assessed
   by digital manipulation of fractured fragment with the help of
   periodontal pocket depth measuring probe in millimeters at pre-IMF and
   after 3 weeks. Pain was objectively measured using a visual analogue
   scale at weekly interval. The data collected were subjected to unpaired
   t test. The experimental group showed significant improvement in
   radiographic density compared with control group at 3- and 5-week
   interval; pain perception was significantly reduced in experimental
   group compared with study group in the subsequent weeks. No significant
   difference was found in clinical mobility between fracture fragments at
   3-week interval. The present study provides a basis for application of
   therapeutic controlled ultrasound as an effective treatment modality to
   accelerate healing of fresh, minimally displaced mandibular fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Supercomputing involves not only the development and provision of
   infrastructures of large capacity for the scientific and business
   community, but a new way to manage the tasks of research, development
   and innovation, making it necessary to use high-capacity communication
   networks that allow the transfer of a great volume of data between
   research and high-performance computing facilities. When first
   implemented, the use of supercomputers occurred mainly in the military
   field, at which point they were very rudimentary, offering little
   possibility of communication networking. Over the years, the improvement
   of security, privacy and service quality in information exchange has
   facilitated the creation of large networks for scientific communication,
   which in turn have allowed the incorporation of infrastructures for
   high-performance computing into the improvement of science. This paper
   analyzes the evolution of Supercomputing and Scientific Communications
   Networks by means of a critical review of its present state, as well as
   identifies the main uses today and predicts the challenges of the future
   uses of this type of advanced services.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Using digital technology to deliver content, connect learners, and
   enable anytime, anywhere learning is increasing, but keeping students
   engaged in technology-mediated learning is challenging. Instructional
   practices that encourage greater engagement are essential if we are to
   effectively use digital instructional technologies. To determine the
   impact of innovative instructional practices on learning, we need useful
   measures of student engagement. These measures should be adaptable to
   the unique challenges to studying technology-mediated learning, such as
   when students learn at a distance or in a blended learning course. In
   this review, we examine existing approaches to measure engagement in
   technology-mediated learning. We identify strengths and limitations of
   existing measures and outline potential approaches to improve the
   measurement of student engagement. Our intent is to assist researchers,
   instructors, designers, and others in identifying effective methods to
   conceptualize and measure student engagement in technology-mediated
   learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have identified affect as constitutive of and woven
   into everyday life. Less work has focused on how affect is designed and
   produced through consumer services and goods to modulate human-technical
   assemblages for commercial and economic ends. In this paper, I draw on
   social geography, affect studies, and postcolonial media studies to
   analyse value creation in the Indian mobile phone market, specifically
   in the deployment of an Indian form of workaround called jugaad'.
   Following nonrepresentational analyses of digital practices, I identify
   this market as a collection of human-technical assemblages that are
   marketed through a rhetoric of frugal innovation or jugaad. Moving
   through examples from fieldnotes, case studies, and reports, the
   analysis of the affective atmospheres of Indian mobile phone marketing
   communications appraises televised Bharti Airtel adverts. Findings of
   this analysis suggest affect has spatial, temporal, and economic
   dimensions, as well as being embedded in everyday experiences of a newly
   distributed subaltern agency.}},

Abstract = {{By the 1990s the dynamic array of creative direct action tactics used
   against militarised technologies that emerged from women's anti-nuclear
   protest camps in the 1980s became largely eclipsed by cyberfeminism's
   focus on digital and online technologies. Yet recently, as robots and
   algorithms are put forward as the vanguards of new drone execution
   regimes, some are wondering if now is the time for another Greenham
   Common. In this article I return to cyborg feminism and anti-nuclear
   activisms of the 1980s to explore what drone feminism might look like
   today. I examine how anti-nuclear protesters infused affect and techne,
   creating innovative images of, and tactics for, material resistance. I
   argue that Greenham women's cyborg feminisms arose from their material
   entanglements with the military base. In their efforts to reveal and
   undermine the national and imperial myths upon which warfare is based,
   protesters re-imagined technological possibilities based upon a global
   accountability for earthly survival'.}},

Abstract = {{This research proposes and validates a design theory for digital
   platforms that support online communities (DPsOC). It addresses ways in
   which digital platforms can effectively support social interactions in
   online communities. Drawing upon prior literature on IS design theory,
   online communities, and platforms, we derive an initial set of
   propositions for designing effective DPsOC. Our overarching proposition
   is that three components of digital platform architecture (core,
   interface, and complements) should collectively support the mix of the
   three distinct types of social interaction structures of online
   community (information sharing, collaboration, and collective action).
   We validate the initial propositions and generate additional insights by
   conducting an in-depth analysis of an European digital platform for
   elderly care assistance. We further validate the propositions by
   analyzing three widely used digital platforms, including Twitter,
   Wikipedia, and Liquidfeedback, and we derive additional propositions and
   insights that can guide DPsOC design. We discuss the implications of
   this research for research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing is the process of joining materials to create
   objects from digital 3-dimensional (3D) model data, which is a promising
   technology in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The management of lost
   craniofacial tissues owing to congenital abnormalities, trauma, or
   cancer treatment poses a challenge to oral and maxillofacial surgeons.
   Many strategies have been proposed for the management of such defects,
   but autogenous bone grafts remain the gold standard for reconstructive
   bone surgery. Nevertheless, cell-based treatments using adipose stem
   cells combined with osteoconductive biomaterials or scaffolds have
   become a promising alternative to autogenous bone grafts. Such treatment
   protocols often require customized 3D scaffolds that fulfill functional
   and esthetic requirements, provide adequate blood supply, and meet the
   load-bearing requirements of the head. Currently, such customized 3D
   scaffolds are being manufactured using additive manufacturing
   technology. In this review, 2 of the current and emerging modalities for
   reconstruction of oral and maxillofacial bone defects are highlighted
   and discussed, namely human maxillary sinus floor elevation as a valid
   model to test bone tissue-engineering approaches enabling the
   application of 1-step surgical procedures and seeding of Good
   Manufacturing Practice-level adipose stem cells on computer-aided
   manufactured scaffolds to reconstruct large bone defects in a 2-step
   surgical procedure, in which cells are expanded ex vivo and seeded on
   resorbable scaffolds before implantation. Furthermore, imaging-guided
   tissue-engineering technologies to predetermine the surgical location
   and to facilitate the manufacturing of custom-made implants that meet
   the specific patient's demands are discussed. The potential of
   tissue-engineered constructs designed for the repair of large oral and
   maxillofacial bone defects in load-bearing situations in a 1-step
   surgical procedure combining these 2 innovative approaches is
   particularly emphasized. (C) 2015 American Association of Oral and

Abstract = {{This essay makes three related claims about digital media creative
   clusters through a case study of the Hub in Glasgow, Scotland. First,
   online social networking platforms are an increasingly common sense
   feature that property developers include to attract media workers to
   purpose-built properties. Second, integrating and managing professional
   identities through the construction of place are considered necessary to
   promote that place to a larger audience. Finally, reorganizing place in
   this way refashions creative work as a more nebulous concept, a process
   that integrates formerly distinct aspects of our work and nonwork lives
   into the common pursuit of innovation for economic gain.}},

Title = {{Digital voice recorders - A conceptual intervention to facilitate
   contemporaneous record keeping in midwifery practice}},
Journal = {{WOMEN AND BIRTH}},

Abstract = {{Background: The first responder, faced with any obstetric incident,
   frequently finds themselves within a dichotomy of multi-tasking
   activities. One challenge for the midwife, is to keep accurate and
   contemporaneous medical records, whilst simultaneously providing
   immediate clinical care.
   Aim: This paper aims to propose an innovative conceptualisation and a
   practical solution for maternity services, which strive to uphold best
   practice in creating contemporaneous and accurate medical records. The
   feasibility of introducing the use of voice recorders within maternity
   services will be explored, and offered as a mechanism to facilitate
   record keeping and simultaneous clinical care.
   Methods: A synthesised narrative review of the literature is conducted.
   This review academically tests the conceptual hypothesis that the
   implementation of voice recorders within maternity services may augment
   the midwife's ability to generate contemporaneous medical records. A
   background literature review will also explore the key drivers for this
   particular innovation, and the challenges facing healthcare leaders in
   service improvement.
   Findings: This paper builds upon previous suggestions that digital voice
   recorders may be an effective solution to enhance overall obstetric
   outcomes, and focuses upon conceptual processes for implementation.
   Conclusions: This paper offers the principal conclusion that the
   integration of voice recorders into midwifery practice for the purpose
   of supporting contemporaneous record keeping may be feasible within the
   current healthcare climate. (C) 2015 Australian College of Midwives.

Abstract = {{``Gerontechnology{''} is defined as the application of mobile health
   (mHealth) technologies to elderly populations. It has conceptual value
   as a means to enhance preventative or therapeutic approaches to care and
   has therefore emerged as a key consideration in innovative healthcare
   approaches for today's rapidly growing older population. In this review,
   we consider our pertinent experiences developing and deploying
   technology in clinical studies facilitated by Wellframe in 2014 and
   2015, specifically in orientation to cardiac rehabilitation and care of
   patients with chronic psychiatric disorders. Wellframe is a Boston-based
   digital medicine company focused on building the next generation of
   infrastructure for clinical care delivery by combining artificial
   intelligence, medicine, and cloud-based computer systems. Goals of these
   projects have centered on the premise of facilitating treatments to
   patients with chronic disease that are more personalized (reliable
   patient-centered healthcare) and herald many opportunities for improved
   care of older adults.}},

Abstract = {{The benefit of digital technologies in healthcare carries a different
   importance from the perspective of stakeholders in innovative forms of
   care. As part of a benefit analysis, these partial interests were
   examined within the example of a supply structure of outpatient
   palliative care. Method: In the form of a multi-methodological approach,
   data was collected in two stages and processed for the benefit analysis:
   1. Telephone survey of existing qualitative benefits and economic
   effects from the perspective of involved stakeholder groups
   2. Analysis of ICT-induced economic effects based on empirical study
   results with the inclusion of contract structures.
   Results: From the perspective of patients, payers and providers the
   qualitative supply potential in the use of ICT is assessed as being
   largely uniform and of high importance. However, efficiency-enhancing
   potential is found, depending on the contractual basis, where only a
   small incentive logically leads to a heterogeneous result. The impact on
   behavior in the form of hospitalizations counteracts this effect in a
   uniformly positive manner. Conclusion: The case study of the SAPV shows
   that the benefit assessment of digital technologies is directly
   dependent on the primary framework of the supply concept. In particular,
   economic values are only important if the involved stakeholder could
   individually benefit from them.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to provide comparative analyses of the
   indicators of knowledge-based economy (KBE) in the Cooperation Council
   of Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) contribute to improve such indicators
   in one member taking comparative advantages from another member country
   and vice versa. Furthermore, the study also intends to develop a model
   of integrating the indicators of KBE in the GCC integration process and
   the spiral of knowledge conversion model. The paper applies comparative
   analyses of the indicators of KBE in the GCC. The study applied 26
   indicators in five categories. Such categories include:
   education/talent, economic and institutional regime, innovation, digital
   economy, and globalization. This study performs analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) to calculate standard deviation, mean, and confidence interval.
   The study also carries out ANOVA to compare between and within
   countries. The required secondary data are obtained from publications,
   country reports, and existing reports of the international
   organizations. The ANOVA reveals significant differences in almost all
   the indicators among the member countries in the GCC. As a result, most
   of the indicators of KBE outperform in one member country compared to
   another. Such phenomenon provides GCC countries with an opportunity to
   gain comparative advantages of one member's outperforming indicators to
   improve another member's poor performing indicators and vice versa
   considering the privileges of the ``GCC Common Market{''}. The study
   revealed that the GCC should forward localized and collective
   microdynamics in education, research, and innovation will contribute to
   understanding and formulating macrodynamics that positively affect local
   community, sectors, institutions, and governance arrangements improving
   the sector-specific indicator of KBE. The GCC also should review the
   experience of others countries such as Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade
   Areas helps adjusting local as well as GCC level policies of education,
   research, and innovation-enhancing knowledge considering its growth
   orientation, culture, and tradition.}},

Abstract = {{Education in the twenty-first century is characterized by narratives of
   global connectivity. Opportunities offered by digital technologies,
   connectivity through mobile platforms, and social media, reinforced by
   changing expectations of students and parents, have put pressure on
   universities to reimagine global learning and flexible delivery
   contained in a modern higher degree. The higher education sector has
   sought to address these developments in a number of ways: through
   intensified student exchange and recruitment, the establishment of
   off-shore campuses, an expanding online delivery presence, and by
   increasing flexibility of delivery for on-campus students. While each of
   the current options taken up by universities addresses different aspects
   of these trends in the sector, all have inherent problems and imbalances
   in their approach.
   In this paper we reflect on the effectiveness of the current trends in
   international education and propose that the innovative `Portal
   Pedagogy' approach outlined here makes a significant contribution to
   higher education. The pedagogy connects geographically distant students
   through technology and curriculum to create a student-centred community
   of inquiry neither bound by disciplines nor countries. Bringing together
   cross-disciplinary interaction, student-driven learning, and
   technological solutions to pedagogical and logistical challenges, Portal
   Pedagogy offers a hybrid model that seeks to go beyond the limitations
   of online delivery and student exchange programmes in order to offer a
   flexible, meaningful, and globalized learning experience.}},

Abstract = {{While being the primary mode of interaction with mainstream digital
   musical instruments, the knob has been greatly overlooked in its
   potential for innovation. In this paper, we aim to open up the thinking
   about new possibilities for the knob. Based on an analysis of the
   background of the knob and the relevant theory on interaction, three
   directives are formulated to guide the design of a new breed of knobs.
   Six prototypes are tested through an AttrakDiff questionnaire and
   Discourse Analysis. It is shown that the proposed new breed of knobs has
   stronger hedonic qualities than knobs of mainstream digital musical
   instruments, though the pragmatic quality appears lower. The strongest
   improvement is seen in stimulation, an important factor in enticing
   investment to play, and as such, more expressive control. Through using
   three directives, a new generation of knobs can be made that would
   improve the expressive affordances of digital musical instruments.}},

Abstract = {{The new media, technologies, and cultural movements influence the
   writing, reading, and organization of texts and their dissemination.
   This raises a series of problems concerning cultural innovations, the
   perception and reading of digital material, and the conflict between
   abstract and globalized information on the one hand and the
   ``down-to-earth{''} stories that stimulate rich experience on the other.
   The author bases his views on the information/story pair on the critique
   of information presented in Walter Benjamin's essay ``The
   Storyteller,{''} and continues by touching on Benjamin's distinction
   between the first and second technology. He expands this distinction to
   also include a difference between the first and second experience. In
   this, the second experience reveals itself as playful and embodied, and
   suitable for experiencing and perceiving electronic literature as an
   area that is extremely challenging for theory because it raises the
   series of issues mentioned above (cultural innovations, the use of new
   media and technologies in literature, and the story/information
   problem). This article presents a critical view on e-literature, which
   has proven to be successful and innovative in the application of the
   expanded poetic language that one can already encounter in modern poetry
   and the concrete and visual poetry of the Neo-avantgarde. This is a
   language that, in addition to verbal signifiers, also uses crossed-out
   letters and white space, positions textual units according to the
   spatial and temporal syntax, and uses conditionally readable and elusive
   text that software allows to be entered and erased, and to appear and
   disappear quickly.}},

Abstract = {{This conversation aims at offering a transdisciplinary gaze on the
   phenomenon of wireless community networks: an emerging typology of local
   wireless infrastructures, which is built by activists as political and
   technological statement to face the hierarchical governance of the
   Internet and the issues of surveillance and control over digital
   networks. By a transdicliplinary gaze - emerging from the dialogue
   between science and technology studies (STS), legal studies, and
   computer science - this conversation focuses on the multi-modal ways and
   perspectives that can be adopted to study CNs; it also offers a
   reflection on challenges and opportunities arising from
   trasndisciplinary scientific work. In the field of STS, a growing body
   of literature has addressed CNs as an emblematic case study to analyse
   the engagement of activists and lay people in the emergence of
   socio-technical infrastructures and technologies. From a computer
   science perspective, community networks represent a challenge to develop
   new routing protocols, and standards to technically implement a
   bottom-up-approach in the building and management of innovative network
   architectures. Finally, from the point of view of legal studies, CNs
   offer the case of a still largely unregulated emerging technology,
   offering a novel field to test existing laws, especially under the point
   of view of the possible allocation of civil liability.}},

Title = {{Investigating digital divide in travel distribution: The use of Internet

Journal = {{TOURISM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{479-496}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, traditional travel agencies face a number of threats, as a
   result of the development of the virtual distribution market, by
   multiplying virtual intermediaries and the direct connection of the
   suppliers to the customers. Minghetti and Buhalis (2010) argue that the
   technological gap, skills in using information and communication
   technologies, attitude towards innovation create a digital divide and an
   exclusion of the organizations that are unable to attend the entire
   distribution network. Among the strategies that the agencies can adopt
   to stay on the market are: more attention to the Internet, the
   personalization of the relationship with customers, brand creation, cost
   reduction etc. The study conducted aims to determine the way in which
   travel agencies in Bihor County approach the online market of tourist
   distribution and what measures they adopt to maintain and develop their
   market position, relative to competitors. The research is quantitative
   combined with qualitative research. The results revealed a poor online
   presence of Bihor travel agencies, the latter not capitalizing the tools
   that the Internet provides. In relation to their competitors, the travel
   agencies prove that they understand the need to be customer oriented,
   toward the relationship with the latter yet without really using the
   electronic virtual channels for interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Platforms have evolved beyond just being organized as multi-sided
   markets with complementors selling to users. Complementors are often
   unpaid, working outside of a price system and driven by heterogeneous
   sources of motivationwhich should affect how they respond to platform
   growth. Does reliance on network effects and strategies to attract large
   numbers of complementors remain advisable in such contexts? We test
   hypotheses related to these issues using data from 85 online
   multi-player game platforms with unpaid complementors. We find that
   complementor development responds to platform growth even without sales
   incentives, but that attracting complementors has a net zero effect on
   on-going development and fails to stimulate network effects. We discuss
   conditions under which a strategy of using unpaid crowd complementors
   remains advantageous. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   about hull plate, the 3D CNC bending machine is emerged. It is a
   breakthrough in the ship 3D surface cold forming area and has great
   practical significance. The key and innovative technologies are as
   follows. They are the square head adjustable die forming device which
   can well solve the indentation and wrinkling problems in the forming
   process, the online real-time detection fast approximation gradually
   bending method which can quickly solve the springback problem of hull
   plate forming and make sure the accuracy and the software and hardware
   integration control system which can realize the digital technology and
   automation of the CNC bending machine. The 3D CNC bending machine can
   solve the high-cost problem of overall die and the wrinkling and the
   indentation problem of the multi point forming technology. Whose
   effectiveness and reliability can be verified through the sail plate and
   the saddle plate cold bending forming experiment.}},

Title = {{Quantifying and Mapping Global Data Poverty}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones
   and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and
   resource management. However, access to these technologies, as well as
   their associated software and training materials, is not evenly
   distributed: since the 1990s there has been concern about a ``Digital
   Divide{''} between the data-rich and the data-poor. We present an
   innovative metric for evaluating international variations in access to
   digital data: the Data Poverty Index (DPI). The DPI is based on Internet
   speeds, numbers of computer owners and Internet users, mobile phone
   ownership and network coverage, as well as provision of higher
   education. The datasets used to produce the DPI are provided annually
   for almost all the countries of the world and can be freely downloaded.
   The index that we present in this `proof of concept' study is the first
   to quantify and visualise the problem of global data poverty, using the
   most recent datasets, for 2013. The effects of severe data poverty,
   particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and
   online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable
   development and disaster risk reduction. The DPI highlights countries
   where support is needed for improving access to the Internet and for the
   provision of training in geoinfomatics. We conclude that the DPI is of
   value as a potential metric for monitoring the Sustainable Development
   Goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the role of annotation in three recently developed
   dance scores'. Synchronous Objects for One Flat Thing, reproduced
   (Forsythe/OSU 2009), Using the Sky (Motion Bank/Hay 2013) and A
   Choreographer's Score (De Keersmaeker and Cveji 2012), each utilize
   annotation in various ways to analyse, re-present and reveal the shapes,
   relations and traces of movement. At times annotation provides a hidden
   methodological tool, helping researchers to systematize features of the
   works; in other cases it takes the form of written notes, digital
   inscriptions and spoken articulations. I consider how such methods
   relate to a codified notational system and draw on perspectives from
   philosophy (Apostolou-Holscher 2014; Sabisch 2011) and human geography
   (McCormack 2013) to consider the aesthetics and affect' of annotation,
   highlighting its potential to offer innovative ways to observe,
   understand and experience dance.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency medicine (EM) education is becoming increasingly challenging
   as a result of changes to North American medical education and the
   growing complexity of EM practice. Education scholarship (ES) provides a
   process to develop solutions to these challenges. ES includes both
   research and innovation. ES is informed by theory, principles and best
   practices, is peer reviewed, and is disseminated and archived for others
   to use. Digital technologies have improved the discovery of work that
   informs ES, broadened the scope and timing of peer review, and provided
   new platforms for the dissemination and archiving of innovations. This
   editorial reviews key steps in raising an education innovation to the
   level of scholarship. It also discusses important areas for EM education
   scholars to address, which include the following: the delivery of
   competency-based medical education programs, the impact of social media
   on learning, and the redesign of continuing professional development.}},

Abstract = {{Although composite materials like wood, vulcanized fiber and carbon
   reinforced plastic (CFRP) are already investigated by means of their
   mechanical properties, the abrupt fracture mechanism as well as the
   deformation behavior right before and after fracture has not been
   investigated. However, it is marginally investigated for CFRP because of
   the quite high fracture speed. The knowledge about the damage evolution
   as the crack start and propagation can help to improve the strength and
   sensitivity to fracture by improving the materials structure and to
   utilize these materials for structural applications. For the
   investigated materials, fracture happens abruptly as it is the nature of
   composites and the detailed fracture mechanisms could not be detected by
   conventional measurement techniques. Therefore, an innovative
   combination of testing devices is presented which is able to fill this
   gap. Tensile tests were performed to receive conventional stress-strain
   curves. At the fracture stage, a high-speed camera recorded the fracture
   process. This information could be combined with digital image
   correlation (DIC) to visualize the deformation behavior. At the same
   time acoustic emission (AE) was used to detect the spectrum of
   mechanical vibrations which gives information about the released energy
   due to fracture. The challenging triggering of the high-speed camera was
   solved for each material individually. By using improved light sources,
   the recording speed could be set up to 2 million frames per second
   (Mfps). The investigations show different fracture mechanisms for each
   composite. Wood and vulcanized fiber were also investigated in different
   directions due to their anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, mobile applications have come to constitute an
   ecosystem of their own, becoming an important driver for innovation. The
   consolidation of mobile applications as the prevalent interface for
   content access has consequences for the production, distribution and
   consumption of content, merging the functional spheres of digital
   content: performance, creation, management and communication. This paper
   proposes a functional typology of mobile content applications, along
   with an evolutionary analysis model. It analyses the functional
   evolution of 153 versions of 12 relevant applications developed during
   two years (March 2013 through March 2015). Though statistical
   representativeness is limited, the sample analysis allowed validation of
   the model. The results point to intervention capacity and communication
   capacity over content as important value-added drivers in mobile content
   applications, although not in homogeneous terms for all the kinds of
   mobile applications analysed.}},

Abstract = {{The embedded image processing systems like smartphones and digital
   cameras have tight limits on storage, computation power, network
   connectivity, and battery usage. These limitations make it important to
   ensure efficient image coding. In the article, we present a novel
   heap-based priority queue structure employed by an Adaptive Scanning of
   Wavelet Data scheme (ASWD) targeting an embedded platform. ASWD is a
   context modeling block implemented via priority queues in a
   wavelet-based image coder to reorganize the wavelet coefficients into
   locally stationary sequences. The architecture we propose exploits
   efficient use of FPGA's on-chip dual-port memories in an adaptive
   manner. Innovations of index-aware system linked to each element in the
   queue makes the location of queue element traceable in the heap as per
   the requirements of the ASWD algorithm. Moreover, use of 4-port memories
   along with intelligent data concatenation of queue elements yielded in a
   cost effective enhanced memory access. The memory ports are adaptively
   assigned to different units during different processing phases in a
   manner to optimally take advantage of memory access required by that
   phase. The architectural innovations can also be exploited in other
   applications that require efficient hardware implementations of generic
   priority queue or classical sorting applications which sort into the
   index. We designed and validated the hardware on an Altera's Stratix IV
   FPGA as an IP accelerator in a Nios II processor based System on Chip.
   We show that our architecture at 150MHz can provide 45X speedup compared
   to an embedded ARM Cortex-A9 processor at 666MHz targeting the
   throughput of 10MB/s.}},

Abstract = {{To gain insight into how to promote teachers' use of digital learning
   materials (DLMs) in their pedagogical practices we adopted the
   Integrated Model of Behaviour Prediction to investigate the
   relationships between organizational and teacher-related variables. A
   representative sample of 772 teachers from primary, secondary or
   vocational education took part in a survey study. Conjectured
   combinations of direct and indirect relationships between the variables
   were tested for the best model fit with structural equation modelling.
   The results suggest that a model with mediating relations from
   leadership through information and communication technology (ICT) policy
   and professional development activities to the variables self-efficacy,
   attitude and social norm, combined with direct relations from leadership
   to the latter, has the best fit for predicting teachers' intention to

Abstract = {{Many service firms deliver services via a mix of internally developed
   and delivered (i.e., insourced) and externally developed and delivered
   (i.e., outsourced) service processes. Service process outsourcing is
   especially common in e-retailing. Portions of e-retail customer ordering
   processes and delivery processes can be digitized and contracted to
   thirdparty vendors. Via outsourcing, service systems change from dyadic
   to triadic. Prior research examines consumer perceptions of dyadic
   (consumer to e-retailer) outcomes, but little research considers service
   co-delivery with outsourcing partners (i.e., triadic systems).
   Literature also does not focus on joint associations of service process
   outsourcing and customer traffic with e-retailer operations. We analyze
   several years of data on North American e-retailers. We first examine
   factors associated with e-retailer outsourcing levels, for front-end and
   back-end service processes. We observe customer traffic is positively
   associated with future outsourcing. We then examine how outsourcing
   moderates associations between contemporaneous customer traffic and
   e-retailer operational performance, as measured by numbers of processed
   orders, website response times, and customer satisfaction. Results
   suggest outsourcing levels are associated with operational outcomes, yet
   surprisingly, high outsourcing and high traffic jointly may not benefit
   e-retailers.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing upon the insights from economic geography and regional
   innovation systems, this paper examines whether and how the
   agglomeration of industries influences their innovative outputs, with a
   focus on the importance of regional institutions in the Chinese context.
   Based on a dataset that covers 29 two-digit SIC manufacturing industries
   in 30 provincial-level Chinese regions in 2009, it found that
   specialization externalities within industries do exist in Chinese
   regions. These impacts are further moderated by regional institutional
   factors, suggesting that the benefits of localization economies are
   predicated on the development of institutions in regions. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the upgrading of the primary distribution networks
   applying the smart grid strategies. In particular, a new research field
   is devoted to the application of storage systems for the power quality
   improvement and the better exploitation of renewable sources. In this
   context, this work proposes the use of a storage based on lithium-ion
   batteries for the black start and island operation of a portion of the
   medium voltage network. The innovation of the idea proposed is related
   to a soft start of the system that reduces transient overvoltages and
   transient inrush current components in order to reduce the stress of the
   system and allow the supply in island through direct current/alternating
   current converters. Simulations carried out on a dedicated model
   implemented in real-time digital simulator are reported and analyzed.
   These tests are the basis for a full-scale prototype installation of the
   storage in a real Italian network as a part of a big project founded by
   the Italian Energy Authority. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new technique for detecting and rendering the total
   appearance of a drawing with the aim of digitally visualizing fine
   drawing collections with perceptive accuracy. A drawing's total
   appearance can be measured using equipment commonly found in a
   photographic studio. The system consists of four strobes and an RGB
   camera. The appearance is defined by its spatially varying spectral
   reflectance factor, surface macrostructure and surface microstructure.
   Using stereo-photometric principles, images of each light source taken
   sequentially from 45 by the normal and annularly at each 90 angle (for
   four lights) were used to measure the surface normal and diffuse
   reflectance. An OpenGL viewer was written to render images for specific
   geometries and for studio lighting. The pipeline from acquisition to
   visualization was tested on the most famous drawing in existence,
   Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Digital technology is changing nature conservation in increasingly
   profound ways. We describe this impact and its significance through the
   concept of `digital conservation', which we found to comprise five
   pivotal dimensions: data on nature, data on people, data integration and
   analysis, communication and experience, and participatory governance.
   Examining digital innovation in nature conservation and addressing how
   its development, implementation and diffusion may be steered, we warn
   against hypes, techno-fix thinking, good news narratives and unverified
   assumptions. We identify a need for rigorous evaluation, more
   comprehensive consideration of social exclusion, frameworks for
   regulation and increased multi-sector as well as multi-discipline
   awareness and cooperation. Along the way, digital technology may best be
   reconceptualised by conservationists from something that is either good
   or bad, to a dual-faced force in need of guidance.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue crack growth was investigated in a line pipe steel. Severe
   straining conditions, like those experienced by pipelines, were
   considered during the experiments. Crack closure effects were
   investigated during the tests by adopting an innovative technique based
   on digital image correlation. Experimentally measured crack closure
   levels were implemented in a crack propagation model based on
   elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. A modified formulation of Delta
   J(eff), necessary to accurately describe crack propagation driving
   forces, is presented and employed to assess fatigue life in presence of
   high plastic strains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Representatives from economy, politics, and science propose a change of
   the paradigm for industrial developments for the next decade. Under the
   term ``Industry 4.0{''} they predict new industrial processes and
   business cases based on cyber-physical systems and the Internet of
   things.
   These developments understood as steps of industrial revolutions are
   offering chances and are having impacts for cyber-physical transport
   systems. They ask for new structures for the cooperation between
   transport organisations und transport users to be able to establish a
   transport culture aiming at a sustainable balance between demand for
   mobility and available transport capacities: ``Mobility Governance{''}.
   Cyber-physical transport systems will at the same time be innovators for
   the objectives of an ``Industry 4.0{''}.
   For the design of future transport systems and for the provision of the
   required quality of mobility actions are required in addition to their
   financing on two levels. First on the level of the techniques and
   management of the transport infrastructure system and second on the
   institutional level for their administrative structures. Under the
   objective to establish ``mobility as a service{''} governance structures
   appear to be the appropriate approach in fostering the cooperation
   between politics, economy, and civil society.}},

Abstract = {{Rail transport, despite many advantages, is subject to a competitive
   disadvantage due to the fragmentation of national rules, national
   authorization processes, and nationalized products (both rolling stock
   and signaling). The main tasks of the European Railway Agency (ERA) are
   safety of railway operation, the creation of the regulatory basis for
   interoperability in Europe, and the role of system authority for the
   European Rail Traffic Management System ERTMS. The increasing
   digitalization of processes and products in European rail traffic in
   these areas represents an additional challenge to the work of ERA. The
   so-called 4th Railway Package, which is in the final stages of becoming
   European law, will extend the scope of ERA with new competencies, first
   and foremost in view of a European authorization process for rail
   vehicles. With this, the European Railway Agency can contribute to
   making the Single European Railway Area (SERA) a reality in the age of
   digitalization.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) brought innovation to noninvasive
   observation of live cell dynamics seen as cell behavior. Unlike the
   Zernike phase contrast or differential interference contrast, QPI
   provides quantitative information about cell dry mass distribution. We
   used such data for objective evaluation of live cell behavioral dynamics
   by the advanced method of dynamic phase differences (DPDs). The DPDs
   method is considered a rational instrument offered by QPI. By
   subtracting the antecedent from the subsequent image in a time-lapse
   series, only the changes in mass distribution in the cell are detected.
   The result is either visualized as a two-dimensional color-coded
   projection of these two states of the cell or as a time dependence of
   changes quantified in picograms. Then in a series of time-lapse
   recordings, the chain of cell mass distribution changes that would
   otherwise escape attention is revealed. Consequently, new salient
   features of live cell behavior should emerge. Construction of the DPDs
   method and results exhibiting the approach are presented. Advantage of
   the DPDs application is demonstrated on cells exposed to an osmotic
   challenge. For time-lapse acquisition of quantitative phase images, the
   recently developed coherence-controlled holographic microscope was
   employed. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Recognising their growing role in public services, this article draws on
   the notion of enactment' to argue that the internet and social media
   (I\&SM) need to be understood in particular institutional,
   organisational and social contexts. Focusing on street-level bureaucrats
   who deliver frontline services, we explore efforts to integrate I\&SM
   into youth work with clients who are thought to be digitally savvy' but
   also in need of protection from the online world'. As clients can be
   vulnerable and trust is a key relational component,
   organisation-practitioner-client boundaries are complex and under
   continuous renegotiation. However, the layering of new virtual channels
   of interaction adds extra complexity. This change necessitates the
   development of innovative routines, practices and protocols, but these
   are being developed in a wider social context where the norms of using
   social media have not caught up with practice and the use of these tools
   is still often surrounded by moral panic.}},

   cassette and the debate which it aroused?
   This text studies the various authority regimes (in the sense of
   auctoritas) exercised in Mali, local practices (old or recent) vs
   national and international legislations on ``copyright{''}, by showing
   all the tensions, but also the settlements and even the innovations
   which the coexistence of these various regimes generates. In so doing,
   the Malian data are set against with other artistic practices the
   principles of authority of which move away from the geographically,
   historically and culturally situated model of the ``copyright{''}, or
   which invent new models. In the end, this text participates of a wide
   reflection on the universality of the system of ``copyright{''}, and on
   the multiple productions of the modernity.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses an innovative approach to the performance of
   Giovanni Gabrieli's Sonata XX devised by Jamie Savan (treble, mute and
   tenor cornetts), Adam Woolf (tenor and bass sackbuts) and John Ayers
   (electronics). In performance, using Ableton Live software, the two
   performers play the piece eleven times in order to record all 22 parts
   between them, constructing the work through simultaneous replay of
   recorded tracks and the live recording of further tracks, thus enabling
   an audience to experience the work building up in stages. The demands
   and rewards of this process are here articulated through data collected
   from semi-structured interviews with the performers and sound engineer
   and from audience responses. The findings suggest that complex
   challenges are involved in delivering the performance; however, digital
   technology can enable new understanding and enjoyment of this music.}},

Abstract = {{Digital (droplet) microfluidics (D mu F) is a powerful platform for
   automated lab-on-a-chip procedures, ranging from quantitative bioassays
   such as RT-qPCR to complete mammalian cell culturing. The simple MEMS
   processing protocols typically employed to fabricate D mu F devices
   limit their functionality to two dimensions, and hence constrain the
   applications for which these devices can be used. This paper describes
   the integration of vertical functionality into a D mu F platform by
   stacking two planar digital microfluidic devices, altering the electrode
   fabrication process, and incorporating channels for reversibly
   translating droplets between layers. Vertical droplet movement was
   modeled to advance the device design, and three applications that were
   previously unachievable using a conventional format are demonstrated:
   (1) solutions of calcium dichloride and sodium alginate were vertically
   mixed to produce a hydrogel with a radially symmetric gradient in
   crosslink density; (2) a calcium alginate hydrogel was formed within the
   through-well to create a particle sieve for filtering suspensions passed
   from one layer to the next; and (3) a cell spheroid formed using an
   on-chip hanging-drop was retrieved for use in downstream processing. The
   general capability of vertically delivering droplets between multiple
   stacked levels represents a processing innovation that increases D mu F
   functionality and has many potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there are revolutionary achievements in silicon-based
   conventional terahertz (THz) and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) integrated
   circuits, particularly with the advancement of CMOS technology. However,
   unlike Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs), innovative designs
   and lack of various circuit techniques still remain unknown in THz gap.
   In this paper, a multi-band THz amplifier is presented in 40 nm CMOS
   technology with adaptive band selection technique. The smart amplifier
   is able to adjust the band of operation with respect to input signal
   power and frequency. In addition, the circuit performance will be
   adjusted to achieve maximum power gain. In order to achieve multi-band
   external neutralization, self-healing technique is vastly utilized by
   means of tunable transmission lines (TTLs). The proposed smart system
   contains tunable transmission lines, a 5-stage amplifier core, two
   Successive Approximation Register-based analog-to-digital converters
   (SAR ADCs), a digital control core and two on-chip power sensing blocks.
   The fabricated amplifier achieves P-1 of 1 dBm, P-sat of 6.1 dBm and
   power gain of 14.8 dB +/- <1.5 dB from 197 to 288 GHz frequency range.
   The proposed amplifier demonstrates the highest operation frequency
   among all published state-of-arts in all CMOS technologies.}},

Title = {{Validation of a stochastic digital packing algorithm for porosity
   prediction in fluvial gravel deposits}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{329}},
Pages = {{18-27}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Porosity as one of the key properties of sediment mixtures is poorly
   understood. Most of the existing porosity predictors based upon grain
   size characteristics have been unable to produce satisfying results for
   fluvial sediment porosity, due to the lack of consideration of other
   porosity-controlling factors like grain shape and depositional
   condition. Considering this, a stochastic digital packing algorithm was
   applied in this work, which provides an innovative way to pack particles
   of arbitrary shapes and sizes based on digitization of both particles
   and packing space. The purpose was to test the applicability of this
   packing algorithm in predicting fluvial sediment porosity by comparing
   its predictions with outcomes obtained from laboratory measurements.
   Laboratory samples examined were two natural fluvial sediments from the
   Rhine River and Kall River (Germany), and commercial glass beads
   (spheres). All samples were artificially combined into seven grain size
   distributions: four unimodal distributions and three bimodal
   distributions. Our study demonstrates that apart from grain size, grain
   shape also has a clear impact on porosity. The stochastic digital
   packing algorithm successfully reproduced the measured variations in
   porosity for the three different particle sources. However, the packing
   algorithm systematically overpredicted the porosity measured in random
   dense packing conditions, mainly because the random motion of particles
   during settling introduced unwanted kinematic sorting and shape effects.
   The results suggest that the packing algorithm produces loose packing
   structures, and is useful for trend analysis of packing porosity. (C)

   technologies to help deliver conservation objectives. This has led to
   collaborative forms of working with academia to spearhead digital
   innovation. Through in-depth interviews with three UK
   research-council-funded case studies, we show that by working with
   academics conservation organisations can receive positive and negative
   impacts, some of which cut across their operations. Positive impacts
   include new ways of engaging with audiences, improved data workflows,
   financial benefits, capacity building and the necessary digital
   infrastructure to help them influence policy. Negative impacts include
   the time and resources required to learn new skills and sustain new
   technologies, managing different organisational objectives and shifts in
   working practices as a result of the new technologies. Most importantly,
   collaboration with academics was shown to bring the opportunity of a
   profound change in perspectives on technologies with benefits to the

   potential for advancing the understanding of, and facilitating
   interaction with, the natural world. In other sectors, digital
   technology has long been used to engage communities and share
   information. Human development-which holds parallels with the nature
   conservation sector-has seen a proliferation of innovation in
   technological development. Throughout this Perspective, we consider what
   nature conservation can learn from the introduction of digital
   technology in human development. From this, we derive a charter to be
   used before and throughout project development, in order to help reduce
   replication and failure of digital innovation in nature conservation
   projects. We argue that the proposed charter will promote collaboration
   with the development of digital tools and ensure that nature
   conservation projects progress appropriately with the development of new
   digital technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of affordable `recreational' camera traps has
   dramatically increased over the last decade. We present survey results
   which show that many conservation practitioners use cheaper
   `recreational' units for research rather than more expensive
   `professional' equipment. We present our perspective of using two
   popular models of `recreational' camera trap for ecological field-based
   studies. The models used (for > 2 years) presented us with a range of
   practical problems at all stages of their use including deployment,
   operation, and data management, which collectively crippled data
   collection and limited opportunities for quantification of key issues
   arising. Our experiences demonstrate that prospective users need to have
   a sufficient understanding of the limitations camera trap technology
   poses, dimensions we communicate here. While the merits of different
   camera traps will be study specific, the performance of more expensive
   `professional' models may prove more cost-effective in the long-term
   when using camera traps for research.}},

Abstract = {{The Web 2.0 digital environment is revolutionizing how users communicate
   and relate to each other, and how information is shared, created, and
   recreated within user communities. The social media technologies in the
   Web 2.0 digital ecosystem are fundamentally changing the opportunities
   and dangers in disseminating qualitative health research. The social
   changes influenced by digital innovations shift dissemination from
   passive consumption to user-centered, apomediated cooperative
   approaches, the features of which are underutilized by many qualitative
   researchers. We identify opportunities new digital media presents for
   knowledge dissemination activities including access to wider audiences
   with few gatekeeper constraints, new perspectives, and symbiotic
   relationships between researchers and users. We also address some of the
   challenges in embracing these technologies including lack of control,
   potential for unethical co-optation of work, and cyberbullying. Finally,
   we offer solutions to enhance research dissemination in sustainable,
   ethical, and effective strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Apart from animal testing and clinical trials, surgical research and
   laparoscopic training mainly rely on phantoms. The aim of this project
   was to design a phantom with realistic anatomy and haptic
   characteristics, modular design and easy reproducibility. The phantom
   was named open-source Heidelberg laparoscopic phantom (OpenHELP) and
   serves as an open-source platform.
   The phantom was based on an anonymized CT scan of a male patient. The
   anatomical structures were segmented to obtain digital three-dimensional
   models of the torso and the organs. The digital models were materialized
   via rapid prototyping. One flexible, using an elastic abdominal wall,
   and one rigid method, using a plastic shell, to simulate
   pneumoperitoneum were developed. Artificial organ production was carried
   out sequentially starting from raw gypsum models to silicone molds to
   final silicone casts. The reproduction accuracy was exemplarily
   evaluated for ten silicone rectum models by comparing the digital 3D
   surface of the original rectum with CT scan by calculating the root mean
   square error of surface variations. Haptic realism was also evaluated to
   find the most realistic silicone compositions on a visual analog scale
   (VAS, 0-10).
   The rigid and durable plastic torso and soft silicone organs of the
   abdominal cavity were successfully produced. A simulation of
   pneumoperitoneum could be created successfully by both methods. The
   reproduction accuracy of ten silicone rectum models showed an average
   root mean square error of 2.26 (0-11.48) mm. Haptic realism revealed an
   average value on a VAS of 7.25 (5.2-9.6) for the most realistic rectum.
   The OpenHELP phantom proved to be feasible and accurate. The phantom was
   consecutively applied frequently in the field of computer-assisted
   surgery at our institutions and is accessible as an open-source project
   at www.open-cas.org for the academic community.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the latest design and realisation of a low-cost
   innovative online secure geoprocessing service, also known as web
   processing service, which undertakes fully automated real-time, online,
   on-demand precise geo-referenced spatial and attribute data extraction,
   transfer and fusion. The service carries out subsequently immediate
   generation of quasi-realistic geospatial population models for end users
   in the United Kingdom's academic community. The paper presents realised
   system architecture, design and operational mechanisms, processes and
   workflow for automatic precise online service invocation, extraction of
   geospatial data and attributes data from online data-intensive digital
   repositories and services and automatic data fusion of assured integrity
   and quality. As an integral part, these include following-on automatic
   high performance geoprocessing for generating geospatial models and
   service delivery over the Internet. It explains how a set of specially
   designed and coded geoprocessors and associated geo-referencing coding
   system are produced to perform coherently chained actions in a novel
   workflow to act in unison to meet the end users demand. It is believed
   that such types of automated geodata processing services can be used for
   on-demand processing of an ever increasing amount of environmental data.}},

Abstract = {{The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sectors are facing
   unprecedented challenges, not just with increased complexity of projects
   per se, but design-related integration. This requires stakeholders to
   radically re-think their existing business models (and thinking that
   underpins them), but also the technological challenges and skills
   required to deliver these projects. Whilst opponents will no doubt cite
   that this is nothing new as the sector as a whole has always had to
   respond to change; the counter to this is that design `creativity' is
   now much more dependent on integration from day one. Given this,
   collaborative processes embedded in Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   models have been proffered as a panacea solution to embrace this change
   and deliver streamlined integration. The veracity of design teams'
   ``project data{''} is increasingly becoming paramount - not only for the
   coordination of design, processes, engineering services, fabrication,
   construction, and maintenance; but more importantly, facilitate `true'
   project integration and interchange - the actualisation of which will
   require firm consensus and commitment. This Special Issue envisions some
   of these issues, challenges and opportunities (from a future landscape
   perspective), by highlighting a raft of concomitant factors, which
   include: technological challenges, design visualisation and integration,
   future digital tools, new and anticipated operating environments, and
   training requirements needed to deliver these aspirations. A fundamental
   part of this Special Issue's `call' was to capture best practice in
   order to demonstrate how design, visualisation and delivery processes
   (and technologies) affect the finished product viz: design outcome,
   design procedures, production methodologies and construction
   implementation. In this respect, the use of virtual environments are now
   particularly effective at supporting the design and delivery processes.
   In summary therefore, this Special Issue presents nine papers from
   leading scholars, industry and contemporaries. These papers provide an
   eclectic (but cognate) representation of AEC design visualisation and
   integration; which not only uncovers new insight and understanding of
   these challenges and solutions, but also provides new theoretical and
   practice signposts for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We introduce the combination of digital holographic
   microscopy (DHM) and antibody microarrays as a powerful tool to measure
   morphological changes in specifically antibody-captured cells. The aim
   of the study was to develop DHM for analysis of cell death of
   etoposide-treated suspension cells. Results/Methodology: We demonstrate
   that the cell number, mean area, thickness and volume were noninvasively
   measured by using DHM. The cell number was stable over time, but the two
   cell lines showed changes of cell area and cell irregularity after
   treatment. The cell volume in etoposide-treated cells was decreased,
   whereas untreated cells showed stable volume. Conclusion: Our results
   provide proof of concept for using DHM combined with antibody-based
   microarray technology for detecting morphological changes in captured
   cells.
   We use an innovative technique that combines digital holographic
   microscopy and the capture of cells with antibody microarrays as a
   powerful tool to measure cellular morphological changes. With this
   technique, the cells can be noninvasively viewed in 3D over time. We
   obtain results showing changes in cellular parameters including cell
   area, thickness and volume of the captured cells after treatment with
   the cell death-inducing drug etoposide. The cell volume in
   etoposide-treated cells showed a decrease, while untreated cells
   remained stable. Digital holographic microscopy combined with antibody
   microarray technology can be a future method for detecting morphological
   changes in treated cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid evolution of mobile technologies and the increasing diffusion
   of smartphones have given significant opportunities for innovative
   companies to create new payment solutions and offer value-added services
   to their customers. Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile payment has
   been emerging as a noticeable phenomenon that can enable consumers to
   turn their smartphones into digital wallets. Although there has been a
   lot of coverage on consumer acceptance of mobile payments, there are
   only few researches providing guideline to interpret NFC-based mobile
   payments adoption.
   Taking into consideration of theoretical backgrounds of innovation
   diffusion and specific characteristics of NFC mobile payments, this
   study proposes a research framework to provide a profound understanding
   of factors facilitating or impeding the adoption of NFC-based mobile
   payments among Taiwanese consumers. The results revealed that intention
   to adopt NFC mobile payments is affected by most of product-related
   factors, personal-related factors and attractiveness of alternatives.
   This paper is able to advance literature on innovation adoption and
   facilitate technology marketers in NFC mobile payments. It provides a
   useful guideline to help researchers investigate issues related to NFC
   mobile payments. It also brings some managerial implications by
   assisting relevant parties in NFC mobile payments ecosystem such as
   mobile network operators, card issuers, payment processing institutions,
   bank decision makers and merchants when devising their business
   strategies and marketing campaigns to facilitate NFC mobile payments.

Abstract = {{Polymer-based scintillator composites have been produced by combining
   polystyrene (PS) and Gd2O3:Eu3+ scintillator nanoparticles. Polystyrene
   has been used since it is a flexible and stable binder matrix, resistant
   to thermal and light deterioration and with suitable optical properties.
   Gd2O3:Eu3+ has been selected as scintillator material due to its wide
   band gap, high density and visible light yield. The optical, thermal and
   electrical characteristics of the composites were studied as a function
   of filler content, together with their performance as scintillator
   material. Additionally 1 wt.\% of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 0.01
   wt.\% of 1,4 di{[}2-(5phenyloxazolyl)]benzene (POPOP) were introduced in
   the polymer matrix in order to strongly improve light yield, i.e., the
   measured intensity of the output visible radiation, under X-ray
   irradiation. Increasing scintillator filler concentration (from 0.25 to
   7.5 wt.\%) increases scintillator light yield and decreases the optical
   transparency of the composite. The addition of PPO and POPOP strongly
   increased the overall transduction performance of the composite due to
   specific absorption and re-emission processes. It is thus shown that
   Gd2O3:Eu3+/PPO/POPOP/PS composites with 0.25 wt.\% of scintillator
   content with fluorescence molecules are suitable for the development of
   innovative large-area X-ray radiation detectors with huge demand from
   the industries.}},

Title = {{What about Passive Innovation Resistance? Investigating Adoption-Related
   Behavior from a Resistance Perspective}},

Abstract = {{Adoption literature has been dominated by a novelty-seeking paradigm,
   whereas resistance to innovation has received considerably less
   attention as a means to explain and predict adoption-related behavior.
   The lack of a good metric to assess consumers' predisposition to resist
   innovations has prevented the establishment of a common ground for
   empirical research and thus hampered progress to date. This paper
   develops and empirically validates a scale to measure individual
   differences in consumers' predisposition to resist innovations
   (hereafter, passive innovation resistance, or PIR). The proposed
   instrument entails a personality-specific and situation-specific measure
   that assesses individual differences in consumers' predisposition to
   resist innovations, emerging from their inclination to resist changes
   and exhibit status quo satisfaction. The scale represents a measure of
   the generic tendency to resist innovations and thus captures the notion
   of a general disposition to act in a consistent way in various
   situations. The results of multiple studies show that the PIR scale has
   good psychometric properties, and its relationships with other
   constructs conform to theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the PIR
   scale explains and predicts adoption-related behaviors beyond the
   variance accounted for by traditionally investigated constructs such as
   innate innovativeness, big-five personality dimensions, or demographic
   variables. These results clearly reveal the importance of PIR for
   determining adoption-related behavior but contest a conceptualization of
   constructs that tap only novelty seeking at a high level as the direct
   antecedent of adoption. Research that attempts to explain and predict
   adoption-related behavior can benefit from taking a resistance
   perspective as well.}},

Abstract = {{Using Rogers' diffusion of innovation model, this study examined the
   relationships between lifestyles and the adoption of six new
   technologies in Taiwan. Three of the six technologiesnotebooks,
   netbooks, and tablet PCsare information technologies, while the
   remaining three technologiesWii, Kinect, and digital videos (DVs)are
   entertainment technologies. A telephone survey was adopted to obtain a
   representative sample, which obtained 1157 valid calls with a response
   rate of 53.1\%. Two conclusions are drawn from the data analysis. First,
   lifestyles did play a significant role in predicting the adoption of the
   six technologies. Second, this study found that demographics and mass
   media use were more predictive of the adoption of information
   technologies than that of the adoption of entertainment technologies.}},

Abstract = {{``Creative development{''} and ``creativity{''} have become important
   topics in the field of education research. The assessment of creativity
   is a key to understanding how instructional strategies influences the
   creative process and the output of learners. At present, most methods of
   assessing creativity are paper-and-pencil tests scored by individuals.
   Despite the professional training of evaluators, subjectivity in scoring
   assessments remains inevitable. Therefore, a completely objective tool
   of measurement is crucial for the progress of education to eliminate the
   subjectivity in manual grading. This paper presents at first place a
   review of the literature related to the development of creativity, the
   assessment of creativity, and further on the means of measuring
   creativity, particularly in a digital game environment. Our focus is on
   the application of computing technologies for the assessment of
   creativity, while exploring the possibility of using computerized
   systems such as fuzzy logic and hybrid methods to produce objective
   measurement results. The results of Pearson correlation coefficient
   between the fuzzy inference scores and the Williams CAP scores is 0.805,
   which shows the strong construct validity. Additionally, the fuzzy
   inference system can eliminate subjectivity in scoring and provide
   analysis results to enhance creativity, unlike paper-and-pencil scores
   provided without explanations.}},

Abstract = {{Governments around the world want to develop their ICT industries.
   Researchers and policymakers thus need a clear picture of digital
   businesses, but conventional datasets and typologies tend to lag
   real-world change. We use innovative `big data' resources to perform an
   alternative analysis for all active companies in the UK, focusing on
   ICT-producing firms. Exploiting a combination of observed and modelled
   variables, we develop a novel `sector-product' approach and use text
   mining to provide further detail on key sector-product cells. We find
   that the ICT production space is around 42\% larger than SIC-based
   estimates, with around 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT
   employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this
   result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope,
   selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to
   reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use. (C) 2015

   professionals and an assortment of business discourses, I find that this

   exhibit a networked hypersociality and a participatory exhibitionism. A
   variety of innovative promotional tactics are being used to solicit
   self-expression and cultivate community within branded spaces and flows
   online. This development could reshape the advertising industry as
   commercialization further blurs with social and cultural content,
   obfuscating branding's persuasive purpose from audiences. It also raises
   concerns about commercialization hijacking the political potential of an
   often-cited empowering new media environment as well as diminishing
   opportunity for youth identity to exist autonomous from the consumer
   marketplace at a time of escalating personal debt.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the theory, algorithm, and results of a new bistatic
   interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method. It employs the
   data acquired in an innovative bistatic configuration, which uses the
   orbital sensors as transmitters of opportunity and the stationary
   receivers on the ground, to generate a digital elevation model (DEM). In
   the bistatic spaceborne/stationary InSAR configuration, the
   interferometric phase only depends on the target-receiver range, which
   could not be obtained directly from the measured bistatic range.
   Therefore, the conventional transforming relationship between the
   interferometric phase and the topographic height is no longer practical.
   In order to solve the problem, we introduce a new conversion
   relationship between the interferometric phase and the topographic
   height, which is derived by the model of the ellipsoidal projection in
   the bistatic configuration. Meanwhile, the error analysis of the new
   conversion is carried out through a simulation. Both the simulated and
   measured data are used to test and verify the feasibility of the new
   bistatic InSAR method. In the spaceborne/stationary InSAR experiment,
   YaoGan-3 (an L-band spaceborne SAR system launched by China) was
   selected as the transmitter and two stationary receivers were mounted on
   the top of a tall building. The generated DEM of high quality shows that
   the presented method performs very well in the bistatic InSAR data
   process.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of an investigation that analyzes how
   the teaching of Colombian History is favored in the context of the
   reconstruction process of Historical Memory in High School through the
   educational innovation based on evidences in electronic portfolios. The
   case study methodology was introduced in the context of the Social
   Studies class in a school in Bogota, in which the electronic portfolio
   was incorporated for the construction of evidences. The study was guided
   by three categories of analysis: namely, educational innovation based on
   evidences, electronic portfolios, and teaching in history in high
   school. The results obtained showed a tight relationship between the
   categories concerning four areas: innovation as a transformation process
   of educational situations and within the process the special relevance
   of the construction of evidences as a support for learning, the
   incorporation of collaboration and thinking as decisive factors in the
   innovation process, the electronic portfolio as a tool that fostered the
   development of critical and proactive skills, as well as citizenship
   education as a field each time more and more relevant in the Colombian
   context of understanding of the armed conflict; and finally, the
   initiatives of Historical Memory that are needed to bring peace and
   reconciliation from the educational institutions.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Research alone does not inform practice, rather a process of knowledge
   translation is required to enable research findings to become meaningful
   for practitioners in their contextual settings. However, the
   translational process needs to be an iterative cycle so that the
   practice itself can be reflected upon and thereby inform the ongoing
   research agenda. This paper presents the initial findings of a study
   into an international, participatory model of knowledge mobilisation in
   the context of translational research in the field of education. Using a
   mixed methods approach, the study draws upon data collected from the
   Education Futures Collaboration (EFC), an educational charity, which has
   developed an international knowledge mobilisation strategy. Through the
   innovative use of technologies, this initiative improves the link
   between research and practice by finding new and practical ways to
   improve the knowledge base for practitioners. The EFC has developed two
   work strands within the international knowledge mobilisation strategy,
   which utilises two complementary digital platforms. The first is the
   online MESHGuides (Mapping Educational Specialist knowHow), a
   collaborative tool for connecting educators with visual summaries of
   educational research from which practice can be developed. The second is
   the online Education Communities of Practice network, which is used to
   support international partnerships for collaboration between researchers
   and practitioners. Findings indicate that utilising web 2.0 tools to
   develop translational research through MESHGuides is significantly
   groundbreaking in its vision and scope with respect to practitioners
   accessing and building the knowledge base of the teaching profession
   internationally and strengthening the link between researchers and
   practitioners, thereby increasing the impact of research in education.}},

Abstract = {{A dominant discourse on scaling-up small-scale innovations based on a
   limited number of successful classroom trials pervades the educational
   literature. We view this discourse as insensitive to the professional
   work of teachers and the human side of school change. Our research
   investigated how teacher professional development could be conceived and
   conducted to support take up of digital game-based learning in the
   context of a 3-week social studies unit on governance and citizenship.
   Students played a mobile game in their own time. In the classroom,
   teachers enacted dialogic pedagogy to facilitate students'
   meaning-making of their gameplay experience. Our findings indicate that
   teacher identity, constituted by their interwoven
   knowing-doing-being-valuing is central to any effort to scale
   pedagogical and technological innovation. We modified our original model
   for the appropriation of innovation uptake by teachers to one that
   places teacher identity as the centrepiece of the model and cornerstone
   in shifting teacher practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of computer-aided learning in education can be
   advantageous, especially when interactive three-dimensional (3D) models
   are used to aid learning of complex 3D structures. The anatomy of the
   ventricular system of the brain is difficult to fully understand as it
   is seldom seen in 3D, as is the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This
   article outlines a workflow for the creation of an interactive training
   tool for the cerebral ventricular system, an educationally challenging
   area of anatomy. This outline is based on the use of widely available
   computer software packages.
   Methods: Using MR images of the cerebral ventricular system and several
   widely available commercial and free software packages, the techniques
   of 3D modelling, texturing, sculpting, image editing and animations were
   combined to create a workflow in the creation of an interactive
   educational and training tool. This was focussed on cerebral ventricular
   system anatomy, and the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.
   Results: We have successfully created a robust methodology by using key
   software packages in the creation of an interactive education and
   training tool. This has resulted in an application being developed which
   details the anatomy of the ventricular system, and flow of cerebrospinal
   fluid using an anatomically accurate 3D model. In addition to this, our
   established workflow pattern presented here also shows how tutorials,
   animations and self-assessment tools can also be embedded into the
   training application.
   Conclusions: Through our creation of an established workflow in the
   generation of educational and training material for demonstrating
   cerebral ventricular anatomy and flow of cerebrospinal fluid, it has
   enormous potential to be adopted into student training in this field.
   With the digital age advancing rapidly, this has the potential to be
   used as an innovative tool alongside other methodologies for the
   training of future healthcare practitioners and scientists. This
   workflow could be used in the creation of other tools, which could be
   developed for use not only on desktop and laptop computers but also
   smartphones, tablets and fully immersive stereoscopic environments. It
   also could form the basis on which to build surgical simulations
   enhanced with haptic interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children
   worldwide. Each year, pneumonia kills an estimated 935,000 children
   under five years of age, with most of these deaths occurring in
   developing countries. The current approach for pneumonia diagnosis in
   low-resource settings-using the World Health Organization Integrated
   Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) paper-based protocols and relying
   on a health care provider's ability to manually count respiratory
   rate-has proven inadequate. Furthermore, hypoxemia-a diagnostic
   indicator of the presence and severity of pneumonia often associated
   with an increased risk of death-is not assessed because pulse oximetry
   is frequently not available in low-resource settings. In an effort to
   address childhood pneumonia mortality and improve frontline health care
   providers' ability to diagnose, classify, and manage pneumonia and other
   childhood illnesses, PATH collaborated with the University of Washington
   to develop ``mPneumonia,{''} an innovative mobile health application
   using an Android tablet. mPneumonia integrates a digital version of the
   IMCI algorithm with a software-based breath counter and a pediatric
   pulse oximeter. We conducted a design-stage usability field test of
   mPneumonia in Ghana, with the goal of creating a user-friendly
   diagnostic and management tool for childhood pneumonia and other
   childhood illnesses that would improve diagnostic accuracy and
   facilitate adherence by health care providers to established guidelines
   in low-resource settings. The results of the field test provided
   valuable information for understanding the usability and acceptability
   of mPneumonia among health care providers, and identifying approaches to
   iterate and improve. This critical feedback helped ascertain the common
   failure modes related to the user interface design, navigation, and
   accessibility of mPneumonia and the modifications required to improve
   user experience and create a tool aimed at decreasing mortality from
   pneumonia and other childhood illnesses in low-resource settings.}},

Title = {{Gene duplications are extensive and contribute significantly to the
   toxic proteome of nematocysts isolated from Acropora digitifera
   (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Scleractinia)}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Gene duplication followed by adaptive selection is a
   well-accepted process leading to toxin diversification in venoms.
   However, emergent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence now
   challenges this role to be at best equivocal to other processess.
   Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that
   are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine
   the evolution of this trait.
   Methods: Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of
   the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic
   analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine
   the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in
   this reef-building coral species. A new bioinformatics tool called
   HHCompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the
   genomic data, which is made freely available
   (https://github.com/rgacesa/HHCompare).
   Results: A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted
   from the A. digitifera genome, of which 36 (65 \%) had likely arisen by
   gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using
   two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly, only 22 \% (12/55) of the
   potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous
   proteomic analysis, for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome
   could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates.
   Biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative
   phospholipases and toxic peptidases.
   Conclusions: Gene expansions in A. digitifera venom are the most
   extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication
   plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral
   species. Since such low numbers of toxins were detected in the proteome,
   it is unlikely that the venom is evolving rapidly by prey-driven
   positive natural selection. Rather we contend that the venom has a
   defensive role deterring predation or harm from interspecific
   competition and overgrowth by fouling organisms. Factors influencing
   translation of toxin encoding genes perhaps warrants more profound
   experimental consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Within recent years, public health interventions have become technology
   based to reflect the digital age we currently live in and appeal to the
   public in innovative and novel ways. The Internet breaks down boundaries
   distance imposes and increases our ability to reach and connect with
   people. Internet-based interventions have the potential to expand access
   to effective behavioral interventions (EBIs). The US National HIV/AIDS
   Strategy states that people living with HIV should have access to EBIs
   such as healthy relationships (HR) to help them develop safe sex and
   disclosure skills. However, access to HR is limited across the country,
   especially for people in remote or rural areas. Internet-based healthy
   relationships video groups (HR-VG) delivered at home or community-based
   organizations (CBOs) can possibly expand access. This study assesses the
   preferences of women living with HIV (WLH) for participation in HR-VG
   among 21 WLH who participated in a randomized control trial (RCT)
   testing HR-VG and completed open-ended semi-structured telephone
   interviews. Transcripts were thematically analyzed to determine
   advantages and disadvantages of home or CBO delivery of HR-VG. Themes
   relating to convenience, technology access, privacy, distractions, HIV
   serostatus disclosure, and social opportunities were identified as
   advantages or disadvantages to participating in HR-VG at each location.
   Overall, privacy was the most salient concern of accessing HR-VG at home
   or at a CBO. Considering the concerns expressed by WLH, further studies
   are needed to assess how an Internet-based intervention delivered at
   home for WLH can maintain privacy while being cost effective.}},

Abstract = {{Digital action cameras (ACs) are increasingly being utilized for aquatic
   research purposes due to their cost effectiveness, versatility,
   high-resolution imagery, and durability. Here we review the advantages
   of AC technology in research, with particular emphases on (a) research
   videography (both in the field and the laboratory), (b) animal-borne
   studies, and (c) outreach and education purposes. We also review some of
   the limitations of this technology as represented by environmental
   factors (e.g., depth, turbidity) and deployment considerations (e.g.,
   lens choices, imaging settings, battery life). As AC technologies evolve
   in response to growing public interest in their application versatility,
   researchers are indirectly reaping the rewards, with technological
   advances that are innovative, cost-effective, and can withstand frequent
   use in dynamic and rugged field conditions. With such a diversity of
   options available, future usefulness of ACs in research will only be
   limited by the creativity of the scientists using them.}},

Abstract = {{Despite multiple efforts and considerable funding, historically
   marginalized groups (e.g., racial minorities and women) continue not to
   enter or persist in the most lucrative of fields - technology.
   Understanding the potency of culturally responsive teaching (CRT), some
   technology-enrichment programs modified CRP principles to establish a
   culturally responsive computing (CRC) experience for disenfranchised
   groups. We draw from our respective praxes developing two such
   initiatives and reconceptualize CRC as a heuristic. In this theoretical
   article, we offer a more nuanced vision of CRC considering
   intersectionality, innovations, and technosocial activism. Implications
   for the newly defined tenets consider programmatic, theoretical, and
   methodological concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Teachers who attempt pedagogical innovation with authentic digital games
   face significant challenges because such games instantiate open systems
   of learner activity, inviting enquiry learning rather than knowledge
   acquisition. However, school environments are normatively sanctioned
   cultural spaces where direct instruction and high-stakes tests are de
   riguer. In this paper, we draw on the conceptual frame of dilemmatic
   spaces to illuminate the dilemmas teachers encounter when attempting to
   reconstruct professional practice in the classroom. We worked with nine
   teachers who enacted the Statecraft X social studies curriculum. Drawing
   on coded interview data, our findings suggest that teachers are forced
   to wrestle with tensions engendered by misalignments that emerge from
   the innovation's tacit requirement for change and the system's inherent
   gravitation towards maintaining the status quo. A school culture that
   cultivates innovative practice based on greater teacher agency is needed
   for authentic game-based learning to find traction in the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{The European Project (E-learning, Communication, includes) ECO is
   potentializing an educational model that seeks to avoid all kinds of
   hierarchical and one-way communication, since the new reality of the
   MOOC. Based on the principles of equity, social inclusion,
   accessibility, autonomy and openness, the empowerment of students
   becomes reality with this proposal for an innovative training, breaking
   the barriers of the digital space of the course MOOC to affect the
   social layer from the interaction in social networks.
   Taking as a reference a MOOC of ECO, the results presented in this study
   have been analyzed from a qualitative methodology opting for analysis,
   such as intentional sample, virtual learning community that develops in
   the course. It is intended to achieve with the research aims to analyze
   the written speech that keep teachers and participants of the MOOC
   ``Educational innovation and professional development. The possibilities
   and limitations of ICT{''}, within the forums and groups. It is opted
   for this type of analysis to identify the advantages and disadvantages
   that the members of the learning community value around the course
   object of study. According to figure in the project itself, this
   proposal is presented as an invitation to reflect on the role that the
   massive formation, online and open plays today, in any learning process,

Abstract = {{This diachronic study describes an innovative university experience
   consisting of the development of multimedia concept maps (MCM) in
   relation to social educators and social workers main intervention areas
   and an active discussion in online forums about the results obtained.
   These MCMs were prepared by students who attended the Information
   Technologies and Communication course as part of the Degree in Social
   Education and dual Degree in Social Education and Work during the
   academic years 2010-13 at Pablo Olavide University (Seville-Spain).
   Following a methodological framework based on virtual, collaborative
   action-research, a qualitative analysis is implemented to analyze 213
   MCMs created by students and their interventions in ad hoc online
   discussion forums with a twofold methodological approach: firstly a
   qualitative analysis of word frequencies in MCM through the use of
   Atlas-Ti software and secondly a forum discussion categorization through
   a reticular, category based social network analysis using UCINET and yED
   Graph Editor. Among the most relevant conclusions, we can highlight that
   a combination of MCMs and discussion forums are highly interactive and
   collaborative digital resources and are especially beneficial when
   applied to social studies. Students were able to identify and categorize
   key areas of social and educational intervention, including: seniors,
   children, teens and drug dependence, people with disabilities, adults,
   mental health, socio-community care, and immigrants.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the most useful surgical
   method for the treatment of skin cancer. One of the key factors in MMS
   is the mapping of the excised tissue in relation to its original
   location. Since the introduction of MMS, mapping has been modified from
   simple drawing to digital photographic maps.
   Method: Maps during MMS were taken using Samsung and LG tablets. The
   maps were saved to the cloud in the operating rooms. A short time after,
   the maps were downloaded to the laboratory's computer by the Mohs
   technician and processed to a digital photographic map. When additional
   stage was needed, the map was uploaded by the technician to the cloud
   and viewed by the Mohs surgeon on the tablet in the operating room.
   Conclusion: Mohs mapping on the cloud is a new method of mapping tissue
   in MMS. It is an easy, fast, and accurate method of mapping and serves
   the new era of modern web and photographic technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Open collaboration has evolved as a new form of innovation creation in
   the public sector. Government organizations are uSing online platforms
   to collaborative create or contribute to public sector innovations with
   the help of external and internal problem solvers. Most recently the
   U.S. federal government has encouraged agencies to collaboratively
   create and share open source code on the social coding platform GitHub
   and allow third parties to share their changes to the code. A community
   of government employees is using the social coding site GitHub to share
   open source code for software and website development, distribution of
   data sets and research results, or to seek input to draft policy
   documents. Quantitative data extracted from GitHub's application
   programming interface is used to analyze the collaboration ties between
   contributors to government repositories and their reuse of digital
   products developed on GitHub by other government entities in the U.S.
   federal government. In addition, qualitative interviews with government
   contributors in this social coding environment provide insights into new
   forms of co-development of open source digital products in the public
   sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper takes our research work with VDAB, the public employment
   service for the Flemish region in Belgium, as a starting point to study
   the transformation of government from New Public Management (NPM) to
   Digital Era Governance (DEG). This study focuses on how to work towards
   disruptive DEG innovation in a turbulent strategic context by employing
   a strategy of simple rules. Together with VDAB, we apply an Action
   Design Research (ADR) approach to develop a simple rules strategy
   specific for VDAB's context, which we call a set of ``boundary breaking
   rules{''}. Coining these rules represents a first significant step in
   VDAB's journey towards achieving a radical business innovation. In
   addition to the main artifact specific for the VDAB context, i.e., the
   ``boundary breaking rules{''}, we derive design principles concerning
   the nature of this artifact. This paper aims to lay the foundations for
   a more broadly applicable design theory of simple rules, useful in
   contexts generalizable from the specific VDAB context. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Peer-based information literacy training: Insights from the NICE
   Evidence Search Student Champion Scheme}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY \& INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{338-345}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There is a widespread acknowledgement that with ever-increasing levels
   of access to digital information sources, students need to be supported
   in the development of their information literacies. Academic libraries
   and librarians have taken the lead in the development of information
   literacy programmes. Whilst there has been much sharing of good
   practise, there has been less consideration of alternative models of the
   outcomes of information literacy programmes. To contribute to addressing
   this gap, this article reports on an evaluation of student peer delivery
   of an information literacy scheme in the specific context of a medical
   and health information portal. The Student Champion Scheme (SCS) is an
   initiative designed to promote the use of a national specialist health
   and social care information portal, Evidence Search, amongst students in
   the health professions, and thereby to further embed evidence-based
   practise. The SCS run by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care
   Excellence, UK), uses a model of training, in which student champions
   are first trained by NICE staff, and then the champions train their
   peers. This study evaluates the scheme on the basis of secondary data
   gathered by NICE during the evaluation processes associated with two
   annual cycles of the SCS, together with focus groups with champions, and
   interviews with prospective university-based co-facilitators of the
   scheme. Findings suggest that the scheme is successful in promoting use
   of the portal, Evidence Search, and in developing advocates amongst
   champions. The evaluation offers a range of insights into the benefits
   and challenges associated with such a scheme, whose interest and
   implications extend beyond this specific scheme. To be successful the
   quality of peer training and peers' identification with and belief in
   the value of both the training they deliver, and specific information
   sources is pivotal. In addition, training is strengthened by
   contributions from librarians and academics, and a climate in which all
   participants are clear about their specific contribution. It is
   recommended that academic libraries should seek to develop a range of
   differentiated information literacy programmes, each with specific
   objectives, to suit different audiences, and undertake regular
   evaluation as a basis for improvement and innovation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An emerging area of inquiry in Internet governance scholarship is the
   role of private information intermediaries in enacting governance via
   technical design choices and user policies. Following this trajectory,
   this paper addresses governance by social media rather than governance
   of social media. Informed by conceptual frameworks from Internet
   governance and Science and Technology Studies, it examines the extent to
   which these platforms either promote or constrain rights in three
   thematic areas: (1) anonymous speech and individual privacy; (2) the
   ability to express ideas or, stated as a negative liberty, freedom from
   censorship; and (3) technical affordances of interoperability and
   permissionless innovation. Because of their unique role as the
   intermediaries providing citizens with access to the digital public
   sphere, social media platforms are central points of control on the
   Internet. Viewing these private platforms through an Internet governance
   lens, rather than a content lens, suggests that social media technical
   architectures and policies actually pose several challenges to
   communication rights as well as to the open Internet There is an
   opportunity for Internet governance studies, which have primarily
   focused on governmental policies and new global institutions, to give
   greater consideration to the direct policymaking role of private
   intermediaries and the accompanying phenomenon of the privatization of
   human rights. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In academia, as well in the industry, there is currently an increasing
   interest in the concept of smart tourism destinations. Specifically,
   there is widespread recognition of the role that ICTs, the Internet of
   Things and Cloud Computing play in providing instruments and platforms
   to facilitate the dissemination of information and knowledge among
   stakeholders, thus enhancing innovation and destination competitiveness.
   Despite that, not much research exists that aims at understanding the
   processes of information and knowledge transfer, sharing, and conversion
   in smart tourism destinations. This paper seeks to deepen the scientific
   debate around this topic by applying a network analytic approach to the
   cases of three tourism destinations. Findings reveal that effective
   knowledge-based destination management studies should consider both the
   virtual and the real components of the network structure of the
   destination. Contributions to the body of knowledge and managerial
   implications are discussed and suggestions for further research are
   given. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of contact pressure on output voltage of triboelectric
   nanogenerator based on deformation of interfacial structures}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{A micro- and nano-structure at the contact interface of triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) is an essential element enabling a remarkable
   performance improvement. Despite the various innovative inventions of
   interfacial structures, there has been little understanding about the
   analytical interpretation of the contact interface. Herein, the
   deformation behavior of interfacial micro- and nano-structures during
   the contact process is systematically analyzed to clarify the origin of
   the contact pressure to output voltage relationship of TENG. The
   visualization experiment, simulation, theoretical modeling, and
   electrical measurements are conducted for the comprehensive analysis.
   The results confirm that the deformation of interfacial structures
   directly determines the pressure-voltage relationship of TENG. The
   surface enlargement effect by interfacial nanostructure formation
   becomes completely valid only when the provided contact pressure is
   stronger than the certain threshold pressure to make the full-contact
   condition. Due to the correlation between contact pressure and output
   voltage, interfacial structure of the TENG should be carefully
   customized depending on the application environment. Based on the
   analyzed pressure-voltage relationship of the TENG, a hybrid circuit for
   energy scavenging and digital pressure sensing is designed and
   experimentally demonstrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{What makes a ``smart region{''} smarter? We argue that it is the active
   orchestration of the regional ecosystem around concepts such as
   knowledge co-creation and exploitation, opportunity exploration, and
   capacity building. Simply adding to the proliferation of software
   developers in the area, stimulating the activities of business clusters
   around information technology, and providing digitally enabled services
   for citizens is not enough to make a region smarter. Smartness is
   enhanced by a well-orchestrated regional innovation ecosystem with a
   strong ``smart specialization strategy{''} that leverages the new
   societal roles played by universities. In this article, we describe the
   European Commission's program for research and innovation strategies for
   smart specialization (RIS3) and show how the Helsinki Region in Finland
   is using smart specialization, ecosystem orchestration, and the active
   role of universities to enhance regional innovation and the
   ``smartness{''} of the region. These activities are discussed in the
   context of policy documents and strategy papers from regional, national,
   and European authorities, which illustrates some differences between
   papers and practice. This is work in progress, and based on early
   results, we draw initial conclusions about how putting policy into
   practice can make smart regions smarter.}},

Title = {{Prescription Tablets in the Digital Age: A Cross-Sectional Study
   Exploring Patient and Physician Attitudes Toward the Use of Tablets for
   Clinic-Based Personalized Health Care Information Exchange}},

Abstract = {{Background: To reduce the cost of health care while increasing
   efficiency and quality, health systems are seeking innovative means to
   engage and empower patients. Improved use of information technology and
   electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure is essential, and required
   for ``meaningful use{''} as mandated by the federal government.
   Providing personalized health information using tablets at the point of
   care could enhance the clinical experience and enable efficient
   collection of patient reported outcome measures to guide clinical
   decision making.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to explore patient and provider
   attitudes and interest in a proposed clinic-based tablet system for
   personal health information exchange. To provide a context to understand
   patients' use of tablets during their clinic visit, we also examine
   patients' current activities and time spent in the waiting room, and
   their use of health information resources.
   Methods: Surveys were administered to 84 patients in the waiting room of
   a community health center affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital
   (MGH) in Boston, MA. This survey included a vignette and illustration
   describing a proposed tablet-based system in which the patient, upon
   sign in at the clinic, receives a tablet loaded with personalized
   information tailored to their specific medical conditions and
   preferences. Patients were queried about their interest in such a system
   in comparison to traditional forms of patient education as well as their
   current health information seeking behaviors and activities and time
   spent in the waiting room. Interviews with five MGH-affiliated health
   care providers were conducted to assess their opinions regarding the
   proposed tablet system.
   Results: The majority (>60\%) of patients were ``very{''} or
   ``extremely{''} interested in the proposed tablet system and thought it
   would improve their knowledge about their medical condition (60\%),
   assist them in making healthy choices (57\%), and help them to feel more
   comfortable talking with their provider (55\%). Patients thought the
   system would be more motivating, informative, and engaging than
   traditional printed health education materials. The tablet system was
   not considered more effective than face-to-face interaction with
   providers, though 44\% thought it would improve their relationship with
   their physician. Overall, 91\% of respondents were willing to learn how
   to use a tablet and 75\% reported being ``very{''} or ``extremely{''}
   confident they could use one. Four of the five providers believed that
   the proposed tablet system would improve clinical workflow and patient
   education. Patients and providers were concerned about privacy and
   security of data collected using the tablets.
   Conclusions: Both patients and providers were highly amenable to
   integrating tablets into the clinical experience, and tablets may be
   useful in improving patients' health knowledge, the collection of
   patient reported outcome measures, and improved patient-provider
   communication. Further research into operationalizing such systems and
   their validation is necessary before integration into standard clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) remain an
   extensive therapeutic option, with new materials and a digital
   fabrication process gradually replacing traditional methods. The variety
   of advances calls for dental schools to expand the teaching of this
   field. Our aim was to examine the nature and the amount of theoretical
   and practical training in clinical FDP courses, and the extent to which
   new methods and innovations in the field are being integrated.
   Materials and Methods: Data were collected using an online questionnaire
   including theoretical and practical teaching regarding clinical courses,
   restorative materials, and new fabrication methods, which was sent to 58
   dental schools in North America.
   Results: A total of 36 schools responded to the survey for a response
   rate of 62.1\%. All the schools teach theoretical and practical
   porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) restorations, and almost all the schools
   teach full-metal FDPs. In more than half (57.1\%) of the schools,
   zirconia-based FDPs are placed by students. Students place partial
   veneer FDPs in less than one-fifth (17.9\%) of the schools. The average
   number of restorations required for completion of the clinical course is
   7.3 FDP units. The respondents assessed that of the total FDPs placed by
   students in the clinical course, tooth-color coping
   (zirconia/alumina/porcelain) FDPs constituted 16.2\%. None of the
   schools produce computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing
   copings or crowns within the school.
   Conclusions: All North American dental schools include teaching and
   placement of PFM restorations in their curriculum, but only one-third
   teach ceramic-based crowns. The low average number of required crowns
   may lead to graduates not being exposed to and trained in up-to-date
   dental restorative materials and techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The discontinuous shift to an electronic exchange system has been a
   catalyst for extensive transformation of financial markets during the
   last decades. Previous research has proposed that there are prohibitive
   regulatory barriers for de novo entrants with limited resources to
   introduce discontinuous technological innovations and novel business
   models in finance. We challenge this notion by studying the
   techno-social transformative process of the first decade of OM, a
   Swedish de novo entrant that introduced the world's first commercially
   successful electronic options exchange and the first for-profit
   exchange. Our analysis reveals that this entrant had a key role in both
   the technological and regulatory construction of the new market through
   a bricolage technological development process and behaved as a proactive
   corporate political entrepreneur (CPE). The first phase of the era of
   ferment in electronic exchange technology was characterized by an
   adaptive techno-social development context that was open for bricolage
   technological and business-model experimentation. In the second phase,
   these experimental lessons were connected to a deliberative regulatory
   process that enabled the entrant to influence the regulatory process. We
   conclude by suggesting that an entrant's dual roles as a bricolage
   technological entrepreneur and as a CPE provide an alternative path for
   resource-constrained entrants to transform capital markets. (C) 2015

Title = {{A servo controlled gradient loading triaxial model test system for
   deep-buried cavern}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},

Abstract = {{A servo controlled gradient loading model test system is developed to
   simulate the gradient geostress in deep-buried cavern. This system
   consists of the gradient loading apparatus, the digital servo control
   device, and the measurement system. Among them, the gradient loading
   apparatus is the main component which is used for exerting load onto the
   model. This loading apparatus is placed inside the counterforce
   wall/beam and is divided to several different loading zones, with each
   loading zone independently controlled. This design enables the gradient
   loading. Hence, the ``real{''} geostress field surrounding the
   deep-buried cavern can be simulated. The loading or unloading process
   can be controlled by the human-computer interaction machines, i.e., the
   digital servo control system. It realizes the automation and
   visualization of model loading/unloading. In addition, this digital
   servo could control and regulate hydraulic loading instantaneously,
   which stabilizes the geostress onto the model over a long term. During
   the loading procedure, the collision between two adjacent loading
   platens is also eliminated by developing a guide frame. This collision
   phenomenon is induced by the volume shrinkage of the model when
   compressed in true 3D state. In addition, several accurate measurements,
   including the optical and grating-based method, are adopted to monitor
   the small deformation of the model. Hence, the distortion of the model
   could be accurately measured. In order to validate the performance of
   this innovative model test system, a 3D geomechanical test was conducted
   on a simulated deep-buried underground reservoir. The result shows that
   the radial convergence increases rapidly with the release of the stress
   in the reservoir. Moreover, the deformation increases with the increase
   of the gas production rate. This observation is consistence with field
   observation in petroleum engineering. The system is therefore capable of
   testing deep-buried engineering structures. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to present and discuss an innovative
   methodology aimed at accessing digitized copies of historical tape music
   audio documents; the methodology leverages on the multimedia and
   multisensory capabilities of mobile devices to provide an unprecedented

   we present an actual software application for Android tablet devices.
   This novel piece of software was designed and developed in a
   multidisciplinary team involving engineers as well asmusicians,
   composers, and archivists. The strongest element in our work is the fact
   that it follows a rigorous process and it is based on the principles of
   philological awareness; thus, it also takes into consideration the
   critical points in the musicologist's domain such as (i) the definition
   of preservation (i.e., master) copy, (ii) the importance of secondary
   information, (iii) the history of production and transmission of audio

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, technology
   has rapidly penetrated the medical device industry over the past several
   years, and innovative groups have harnessed it to create devices with
   unique composition, structure, and customizability. These distinctive
   capabilities afforded by 3D printing have introduced new regulatory
   challenges. The customizability of 3D-printed devices introduces new
   complexities when drafting a design control model for FDA consideration
   of market approval. The customizability and unique build processes of
   3D-printed medical devices pose unique challenges in meeting regulatory
   standards related to the manufacturing quality assurance. Consistent
   material powder properties and optimal printing parameters such as build
   orientation and laser power must be addressed and communicated to the
   FDA to ensure a quality build. Postprinting considerations unique to
   3D-printed devices, such as cleaning, finishing and sterilization are
   also discussed. In this manuscript we illustrate how such regulatory
   hurdles can be navigated by discussing our experience with our group's
   3D-printed bioresorbable implantable device.}},

Abstract = {{New microbes are being engineered that contain the genetic circuitry,
   metabolic pathways, and other cellular functions required for a wide
   range of applications such as producing biofuels, biobased chemicals,
   and pharmaceuticals. Although currently available tools are useful in
   improving the synthetic biology process, further improvements in
   physical automation would help to lower the barrier of entry into this
   field. We present an innovative microfluidic platform for assembling DNA
   fragments with 10x lower volumes (compared to that of current
   microfluidic platforms) and with integrated region-specific temperature
   control and on-chip transformation. Integration of these steps minimizes
   the loss of reagents and products compared to that with conventional
   methods, which require multiple pipetting steps. For assembling DNA
   fragments, we implemented three commonly used DNA assembly protocols on
   our microfluidic device: Golden Gate assembly, Gibson assembly, and
   yeast assembly (i.e., TAR cloning, DNA Assembler). We demonstrate the
   utility of these methods by assembling two combinatorial libraries of 16
   plasmids each. Each DNA plasmid is transformed into Escherichia coli or
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae using on-chip electroporation and further
   sequenced to verify the assembly. We anticipate that this platform will
   enable new research that can integrate this automated microfluidic
   platform to generate large combinatorial libraries of plasmids and will
   help to expedite the overall synthetic biology process.}},

Abstract = {{Divertor is a crucial component in Tokamaks, aiming to exhaust the heat
   power and particles fluxes coming from the plasma during discharges.
   This paper focuses on the optimization process of FAST divertor, aimed
   at achieving required thermo-mechanical capabilities and the remote
   handling (RH) compatibility. Divertor RH system final layout has been
   chosen between different concept solutions proposed and analyzed within
   the principles of Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). The design
   was aided by kinematic simulations performed using Digital Mock-Up
   capabilities of Catia software. Considerable electromagnetic (EM)
   analysis efforts and top-down CAD approach enabled the design of a final
   and consistent concept, starting from a very first dimensioning for EM
   loads.
   In the final version here presented, the divertor cassette supports a
   set of tungsten (W) actively cooled tiles which compose the inner and
   outer vertical targets, facing the plasma and exhausting the main part
   of heat flux. W-tiles are assembled together considering a minimum gap
   tolerance (0.1-0.5 mm) to be mandatorily respected. Cooling channels
   have been re-dimensioned to optimize the geometry and the layout of
   coolant volume inside the cassette has been modified as well to enhance
   the general efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{National Forest Parks are protected under national and international
   environment laws because of their recognized natural, ecological or
   cultural values. Since they provide economic perspectives through
   recreational and tourism opportunities for the public, the visitors'
   overuse and the supplementary development of facilities and services in
   these protected areas are the main threats to their ecological
   integrity. Within the current digital innovations, Internet has become a
   viable alternative business channel and many firms have already created
   their internet presence. The aim of the paper is to study the employ of
   internet technologies in Greek National Forest Parks for economic
   perspectives and rank the websites, respectively. Internet presence of
   Greek National Forest Parks is evaluated qualitatively according to
   their content, used as criteria. Following, the multicriteria method of
   PROMETHEE II is applied for the total ranking. Furthermore, the optimum
   National Forest Parks internet presences are identified and described to
   be used as models with the total exploitation of internet technologies.
   Finally, necessary recommendations for website optimization are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article reflects on our 2003 article, ``Exploitation, Exploration,
   and Process Management: The Productivity Dilemma Revisited,{''} which
   received the Academy of Management Review's Best Article Award in 2003
   and Decade Award in 2013. We consider the context within which we wrote
   the original article, with particular reference to the theoretical,
   empirical, and managerial problems salient at that time, and comment on
   the likely reasons the article has had a sustained influence in the
   field. Looking forward, we first ask whether the paradoxes and
   inconsistencies we discussed are still fundamental organizational
   challenges, and then go further to consider ways the domain of
   innovation itself has changed. We suggest that because of fundamental
   shifts in communication and information processing costs and the
   increasing modularity of products and services, the nature and locus of
   innovation have changed over the past decade. These secular trends have
   profound implications for our theories of innovation and organizations.
   Our extant theory and research are increasingly uncoupled from the
   phenomena. We would be well served to revisit the nature, locus, and
   basic processes of innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) and related digital innovations can
   serve as a catalyst for more transparency, tighter integration, and
   increased productivity in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction industry. Yet, many project teams struggle with how to work
   based on the new technology. Collaborative design based on shared
   information systems like BIM requires changing traditional and
   institutionalized work practices and routines. A case study of
   integrated BIM design in a large healthcare construction project serves
   as an example for how commonly experienced challenges can be overcome.
   The project has been awarded BuildingSMART's 2015 award for `outstanding
   open BIM practice' making it Norway's role model for BIM practice. Based
   on diffusion of innovations theory, we identified the following set of
   key factors enabling digital collaboration in this project: change
   agents, new roles and responsibilities, a cloud computing
   infrastructure, BIM contracts, and a BIM learning environment. The
   findings presented in this article may serve as an example for BIM
   implementation and collaborative work in construction projects. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{E-learning can be defined as learning facilitated and supported through
   the use of ICTs. ICTs can increase students' motivation, accelerate the
   knowledge process and facilitate the information access. The aim of this
   paper is to analyze the acceptability of three tools presented in a
   workshop carried out during six weeks, with university teachers (N =
   22), taking into account their opinion about the usefulness of the
   workshop. Two researchers/teachers specializing in the field of
   educational technologies taught the three tools presented. Before the
   workshop, we administered a technology profile questionnaire; after it,
   we asked the teachers to fill in a questionnaire about the workshop and
   the tools used. We then carried out a non-parametric Friedman test to
   compare the differences found in the evaluation of the tools. The
   results show that the acceptability of the technologies and the
   methodology used during the workshop was high: teachers' assessment and
   opinion has been favorable for both pedagogy and teaching methodology,
   which facilitated the understanding of the tools and the innovative
   nature of the contents of the workshop. The participants also evaluated
   the technologies as appropriate and easy to use. We also mention the
   limitations of the study and future challenges.}},

Abstract = {{This paper performs an experimental comparative study of the total
   ionizing dose effects due to the x-ray radiation between the
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect
   transistors (MOSFETs) manufactured with octagonal gate geometry and the
   standard counterpart. Our main focus is on integrated transceivers for
   wireless communications and smart-power dc/dc converters for mobile
   electronics, where the transistor is used as the key switching element.
   It is shown that this innovative layout can reduce the total ionizing
   dose (TID) effects due to the special characteristics of the OCTO SOI
   MOSFET bird's beak regions, where longitudinal electrical field lines in
   these regions are not parallel to the drain and source regions.
   Consequently, the parasitic MOSFETs associated with these regions are
   practically deactivated.}},

Abstract = {{Using the science citation index and the social sciences citation index
   databases, we performed a bibliometric analysis of the global studies on
   the digital evaluation model (DEM) that were conducted between 1994 and
   2013. We identified the authorial, institutional, international,
   categorical, spatiotemporal patterns, and hotspots in DEM-related
   research. The number of DEM-related publications has been continuously
   increasing since 1994. Geology, engineering, and physical geography were
   the most frequently used subject categories in DEM-related studies,
   whereas Geomorphology, International Journal of Remote Sensing, and IEEE
   Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing were the most active
   journals in the field. Toutin, T., Favalli, M., and Hancock, G. R. were
   the most prolific authors in DEM-related research. Authors of
   DEM-related research were mostly located in the USA, the European Union,
   and East Asia. The USA, China, and the UK were the top three most
   productive countries. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the largest
   contributor of single-institution and collaborative publications on DEM,
   has a key position in collaboration networks. Both the number of
   articles that are internationally and inter-institutionally
   collaborative is increasing, with the former being more prevalent than
   the latter. Through keyword analysis, we observed several interesting
   terminology preferences, revealed the adoption of advanced technologies,
   and examined the patterns and underlying processes of geoscience. In
   summary, our study identified the quantitative, qualitative, temporal,
   and spatial characteristics, academic collaborations, as well as
   hotspots in scientific outputs and provided an innovative method of
   revealing global trends in DEM-related research to guide future studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new physics education programme is specifically
   developed for a famous theme park in Hong Kong to provide
   community-based science learning to her visitors, involving her three
   newly constructed rides. We make innovative use of digital technologies
   in this programme and incorporate a rigorous evaluation of the learning
   effectiveness of the programme. A total of around 200 students from nine
   local secondary schools participated in both the physics programme and
   its subsequent evaluation which consists of a combination of research
   and assessment tools, including pre- and post-multiple-choice tests, a
   questionnaire survey and an interview as specifically developed for this
   programme, or adopted from some well-accepted research instruments.
   Based on the evaluation of students' academic performance, there are two
   educationally significant findings on enhancing the students' physics
   learning: (a) traditionally large gender differences in physics
   performance and interest of learning are mostly eliminated; and (b) a
   less-exciting ride called the aviator (instead of the most exciting
   roller-coaster ride) can induce the largest learning effect (or gain in
   academic performance) amongst teenagers. Besides, findings from the
   questionnaire survey and interviews of participants are reported to
   reveal their views, perceptions, positive and negative comments or
   feedback on this programme which could provide valuable insights for
   future development of other similar community-based programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Research has been abundant in generating studies on pedagogical
   revolution and innovation via technology in higher education
   institutions, specifically the incorporation of social media in
   pedagogical practice. The potential for using social media has been
   proven in studies around the world. The objective of this study was to
   examine the usefulness of Twitter as a communication tool in Information
   Technology courses taken by students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal
   (UKZN) in the Durban region of South Africa. The methodology for this
   qualitative study is a design-based research. Findings overall showed
   that students preferred more traditional ways of academic support such
   as face-to-face conversations, telephone calls and emails rather than
   using Twitter to communicate with their Academic Development Officer or
   their peers. Conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the way
   social media is used in higher education should be reconsidered and used
   only to complement traditional practices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that SDN and NFV principles are going to impact not
   only the evolution of current networks, but also the services and
   applications platforms. In fact, SDN and NFV, together with Cloud and
   Edge Computing, can be seen as facets of a broader systemic innovation
   wave (called softwarization) which is transforming the overall
   telecommunications and ICT ecosystems. Specifically, the paper proposes
   the vision of Software Defined Infrastructures (SDI) as highly dynamic
   and pervasive telecommunications and ICT frameworks of logical resources
   capable of executing (with a trade-off of centralisation and
   distribution) any network and service functions. Eventually, it is
   argued that, in this evolution towards SDI, the border between the
   networks and the Cloud-Edge Computing platforms will gradually
   disappear. On the other side, also the distinction between the networks
   and the future ``terminals{''} (e.g., including machines, smart things,
   drones, robot) will blur. This transformation will have profound
   techno-economic implications for the telecommunications and ICT
   ecosystems, paving the way to the Digital Society and the Digital
   Economy.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate an innovative grassroots community-based campaign in
   Seattle, WA focused on educating African American and African-born
   communities about concurrent partnerships and HIV transmission.
   Respondents completed a short self-administered questionnaire on a
   handheld personal digital assistant to evaluate the reach, acceptability
   and preliminary efficacy of the campaign. Of those who remembered seeing
   the campaign materials (82 \%), social networks were the most common
   source of exposure (80 \%). Respondents rated campaign materials very
   visually attractive (86 \%), very interesting (91 \%), and very
   important for themselves (90 \%) and their community (93 \%).
   Respondents reported that the campaign increased their knowledge about
   concurrency (84 \%), changed their attitudes about it (77 \%), and 65 \%
   said it was likely or very likely that they would change their behavior
   as a result. This inexpensive grassroots campaign demonstrated extensive
   reach in the local black community and was able to move beyond
   individual exposure and into social networks.}},

Abstract = {{Factors influencing the adoption and utilization of technology have been
   extensively studied within a variety of theoretical paradigms but
   questions about their parsimony and their integrations with and
   contributions to overarching models of human behavior have been
   questioned. The present research employed a mail survey of inner city
   residents of a Midwestern state to analyze the sufficiency of the social
   cognitive theory (SCT) model of broadband adoption by testing it against
   variables drawn from the Model of Adoption of Technology in Households,
   Diffusion of Innovations, and the Unified Theory of the Acceptance and
   Utilization of Technology-2. The variables tested explained little
   additional variance in broadband intentions after accounting for SCT and
   demographic variables, arguing for the superior parsimony of the SCT
   model. Price sensitivity, often overlooked in adoption research, was a
   significant predictor of broadband intentions and its effect was
   interpreted through the SCT framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method by
   introducing an auto-adjustment variable step-size algorithm that uses
   only a single sensor. This novel scheme solves the problem encountered
   by traditional variable step-size methods, which require an additional
   calculation of the constant value. The naturally varying trend of the
   proposed function in this paper is applied to serve as the
   auto-adjustment variable step size in the MPPT algorithm, thereby
   enabling the system to provide reliable transient and steady-state
   responses even during sharp weather changes. Furthermore, the proposed
   new MPPT method can also be applied in the presence of a partial shadow
   condition. The digital signal processor handles the feedback value and
   directs the PWM signal to drive the switch of the converter. The
   simulation and experimental results verify the reliable transient and
   steady-state performance of the PV system with the proposed method.}},

   Pleistocene episodes of climatic amelioration remains limited. In this
   paper we outline a combined method for remotely mapping the location of
   palaeodrainage and palaeolakes in currently arid regions that were
   formerly subject to more humid conditions. We demonstrate the potential
   of this approach by mapping palaeochannels across the whole Arabian
   Peninsula, and palaeolakes and marshes for select regions covering c.
   10\% of its surface. Our palaeodrainage mapping is based upon
   quantitative thresholding of HydroSHEDs data, which applies flow routing
   to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, while our palaeolake mapping uses
   an innovative method where spectral classification of Landsat Thematic
   Mapper (TM) imagery is used to detect palaeolake deposits within
   endorheic (closed) basins, before modelling maximum lake extents by
   flooding the basin to the level of the elevation of the highest detected
   deposit. Field survey in the Nefud desert and the Dawadmi and Shuwaymis
   regions of Saudi Arabia indicates accuracies of 86\% for palaeodrainage
   mapping, and 96\% for identifying former palaeolake basins (73\%
   accuracy of classification of individual deposits). The palaeolake
   mapping method has also demonstrated potential for identifying surface
   and stratified archaeological site locations, with 76\% of the surveyed
   palaeolake basins containing archaeological material, including
   stratified Palaeolithic archaeology. Initial examination of
   palaeodrainage in relation to archaeological sites indicates a
   relationship between mapped features and previously recorded
   Palaeolithic sites. An example of the application of these data for
   period-specific regional palaeohydrological and archaeological
   reconstructions is presented for a region of Northern Saudi Arabia
   covering the southern Nefud desert and adjacent lava fields. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The realization of large-area and low-cost flexible macroelectronics
   relies on both the advancements in materials science and the innovations
   in manufacturing techniques. In this study, extremely bendable and
   foldable carbon nanotube thin film transistors and integrated logic
   gates are fabricated on a piece of ultrathin polyimide substrate through
   an ink-jet-like printing process. The adoption of a hybrid gate
   dielectric layer consisting of barium titanate nanoparticles and
   poly(methyl methacrylate) has led to not only excellent gating effect
   but also superior mechanical compliance. The device characteristics show
   negligible amount of change after up to 1000 cycles of bending tests
   with curvature radii down to 1 mm, as well as very aggressive folding
   tests. Additionally, the electrical characteristics of each integrated
   logic gate can be tuned and optimized individually by using different
   numbers of carbon nanotube printing passes for different devices,
   manifesting the unique adaptability of ink-jet printing as a digital,
   additive, and maskless method. This report on fully printed and foldable
   integrated logic gates represents an inspiring advancement toward the
   practical applications of carbon nanotubes for high-performance and
   low-cost ubiquitous flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, and not unlike other Southern Ocean rim
   countries, Chile has experienced a series of fundamental changes in its
   engagement with the Antarctic. This article provides an exploration into
   how these changes are shaping the formation of new local and national
   Antarctic social imaginaries. Through an account of a digital
   storytelling project carried out in the Antarctic Peninsula in 2012 and
   2013 with young Chilean students, the article first examines cultural
   production processes at play in the configuration of a contemporary
   Antarctic national imaginary in Chile, arguing that such processes
   operate through a set of overlapping symbolic and material arrangements.
   Second, it reflects on how a performative focus on the experiences of
   young people doing science in Antarctica provides an innovative shift
   for understanding digital storytelling not only in terms of media
   democracy, but also rethinking its expediency as a novel mode of science
   diplomacy and democratisation of science. Third, and in framing the
   creative engagement process, the article considers the importance of
   bringing attention to thinking about globalism from the southern
   hemisphere in the context of the increasing significance that the
   Antarctic region holds for Southern Ocean rim countries. Highlighting
   the challenge of developing science-citizens interfaces, the article
   concludes by suggesting that we consider the complex entanglements
   between geopolitics, science and citizenship in a broader setting if we
   are to acknowledge that citizens' engagement with critical scientific
   debates and decisions that affect their futures is today more pertinent
   than ever.}},

Abstract = {{Building the information and knowledge society has involved the
   development of numerous projects and initiatives all over the world.
   Portugal is no exception. This work is based on the analysis of the ALO
   Digital Project, which involves a series of strategies developed at the
   local e-government level in four Portuguese counties near Lisbon (i.e.
   Amadora, Loures, Odivelas and Vila Franca de Xira). Having the residents
   of the four counties involved as the target, this paper aims to identify
   the level of electronic service use resulting from the implementation of
   the ALO Digital Project. A questionnaire was administered and the
   results of a regression analysis demonstrate that the project is still
   at low level of online service sophistication. Additionally, despite
   users' overall satisfaction, implementation difficulties were noticed.
   In practical terms, this reveals a type of service more related to
   information consultation, downloading and printing documentation, and
   supports the premise that a change of focus and direction of local
   e-government is needed to substantially improve the life of the
   individual citizen.}},

   digital media tools are often taken up in reductive ways that serve to

   rather than reflect the creativity and innovation that youth practice
   within digital domains. To address these issues, this article shares a
   funds of knowledge approach to the use of new media in classrooms.
   Coupled with an emphasis on new literacies and multiliteracies, this
   approach was instantiated in partnership with Ms Smith and her high

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a case study of an online pre-service teacher
   education course in a New Zealand university aimed at exploring the
   potential of student-generated podcasts as a form of interactive
   formative assessment at a distance. The study was part of a wider
   two-year funded project with the overall goal of documenting,
   developing, and disseminating effective and innovative e-learning
   practice. Findings from lecturer and tutor interviews, student focus
   group (FG) discussion, and course evaluations indicate that the
   podcasting task provided opportunities for the course lecturer, tutors,
   and students to learn and share ideas with one another. The experience
   empowered students to develop the skills and confidence to initiate more
   independent inquiry into technologies to support their pedagogical
   purposes. The study contributes to a better understanding of the skills,
   dispositions, and knowledge needed to prepare teacher candidates for
   teaching-learning contexts where information and communication
   technologies are increasingly pivotal.}},

Abstract = {{This article contributes to an ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue
   between architectural and textile/fashion design. Over the past decade
   architectural theory has re-engaged with the ideas proposed by Gottfried
   Semper in the 1850s to explore new definitions of how material practices
   can be understood and articulated, particularly that architecture can be
   seen as the concretization of textile form and pattern. The article
   discusses three iterations of the architectural column, introducing
   themes of scale, material language, constructional method and formal
   representation and brings together the body, space, structure, form and
   ornament. COLUMN 1 is a highly decorated concrete structural version,
   which is hard throughout, but suggests softness by its reference to
   textile (armature is sleeve). COLUMN 2 is essentially an architectural
   garment. It uses seamless purl and plain knitting with ribs at either
   end. It is a soft tactile textile covering to a hard base (armature and
   sleeve). COLUMN 3 moves away from visual ornament and explores the
   structural 3D form of knitted textile. The structure is entirely soft.
   This iteration opens up possibilities for architectural forms that
   explore the unique properties of seamless knitting, with its inherent
   strength and elasticity. There is the potential when the form is soft to
   challenge a perception that architecture is `fixed' and to develop
   architectural forms that can, through post-construction processes or
   smart materiality, later become hard (sleeve is armature). The research
   brings together through practice architectural and textile/fashion
   references. Their further development through digital approaches,
   innovative materiality and construction opens up a craft/design dialogue
   and interdisciplinary discourse in the exploration and realization of
   novel textile-informed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study aimed to test the acceptability and
   effectiveness of a two-phase mindfulness-based stress reduction program
   (8-week initial treatment plus a 10-month maintenance phase) in
   alleviating work stress-related symptoms (i.e., burnout, heart rate
   {[}HR], and blood pressure {[}BP]) in a sample of 42 physicians.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial and a simple pre-post design were
   used, respectively, for each of the two phases of the study. Outcome
   measures included the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire and the
   Maslach Burnout Questionnaire. HR and BP measures were also obtained in
   the experimental group by means of a digital monitor.
   Results: After the initial 8 weeks of treatment, significant
   improvements for the experimental group in mindfulness levels and
   reductions in emotional exhaustion, HR, and BP were obtained. Effect
   sizes (Cohen d) significantly increased over the 10-month maintenance
   period, especially for mindfulness and systolic BP. Acceptance was
   notably high (low attrition rate and high compliance with program
   activities).
   Discussion: Outcomes are significant in terms of practical consequences
   for reducing and controlling risks of developing burnout and
   cardiovascular disease in this population and enhancing well-being in
   life.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: Currently there are many non-invasive
   radiofrequency (RF) devices on the market that are utilized in the field
   of aesthetic medicine. At this time, there is only one FDA cleared
   device on the market that emits RF energy using a non-contact delivery
   system for circumferential reduction by means of adipocyte disruption.
   Innovation of treatment protocols is an integral part of aesthetic
   device development. However, when protocol modifications are made it is
   important to look at the safety as well as the potential for improved
   efficacy before initiating change. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the safety and efficacy of a newly designed extended treatment
   protocol using an operator independent selective non-contact RF device
   for the improvement in the contour and circumferential reduction of the
   abdomen and flanks (love handles).
   Methods:Twenty-five subjects enrolled in the IRB approved multi-center
   study to receive four weekly 45-minute RF treatments to the abdomen and
   love handles. Standardized digital photographs and circumference
   measurements were taken at baseline and at the 1 and 3-month follow-up
   visits. Biometric measurements including weight, hydration and body fat
   were obtained at baseline and each study visit. A subset of 4 subjects
   were randomly selected to undergo baseline serum lipid and liver-related
   blood tests with follow-up labs taken: 1 day post-treatment 1, 1 day
   post-treatment 4, and at the 1- and 3-month follow-up visits.
   Results: Twenty-four subjects (22 female, 2 male), average age of 47.9
   years (30-69 years), completed the study. The data of the twenty-four
   subjects revealed a statistically significant change in circumference
   P<.001 with an average decrease in circumference of 4.22cm at the
   3-month follow-up visit. Lab values for the subset of 4 subjects
   remained relatively unchanged with only minor fluctuations noted in the
   serum lipid values in two of the subjects. Three independent evaluators
   viewed pre-treatment and 3-month post treatment photographs to determine
   which photo was the after photo. The evaluators were able to correctly
   identify the post treatment photos with an 88\% accuracy rate.
   Treatments were well tolerated by all subjects. No study related adverse
   events were reported.
   Conclusion: This study found that an extended treatment protocol using a
   selective RF device is a safe and effective method for the reduction of
   circumference and improved contouring of the abdomen and love handles.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This article investigates the combination of
   three-dimensional (3D) digital volume tomography data with
   two-dimensional (2D) cephalograms in dentomaxillofacial imaging.
   Methods: An automatic hierarchical method to adjust the geometrical
   relations of these two modalities is presented. The approach is tested
   on phantom and patient case data, where the feasibility, usability and
   potential possibilities of the presented innovative method are
   highlighted. Digitally reconstructed radiographs are computed by casting
   rays through the 3D volume to get a 2D projection of the volume to
   produce realistic simulated cephalograms. Different similarity measures
   are considered based on variations of statistical and deterministic
   optimization procedures. Stability, precision and accuracy of the method
   are investigated.
   Results: The presented algorithm demonstrates a reasonable solution of
   the corresponding 2D/3D registration problem. Exemplary results from
   phantom and patient case data are presented. Tooth movement could be
   determined, in contrast to the 2D lateral cephalogram, separated for
   each side in all three spatial directions.
   Conclusions: Achieved results are highlighted from a clinical point of
   view and demonstrate the clinical benefit in daily praxis.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible and transparent electronics have been studied intensively
   during the last few decades. The technique establishes the possibility
   of fabricating innovative products, from flexible displays to
   radio-frequency identification tags. Typically, large-area polymeric
   substrates such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET) are used, which produces new requirements for the integration
   processes. A key element for flexible and transparent electronics is the
   thin-film transistor (TFT), as it is responsible for the driving current
   in memory cells, digital circuits or organic light-emitting devices
   (OLEDs). In this paper, we discuss some fundamental concepts of TFT
   technology. Additionally, we present a comparison between the use of the
   semiconducting organic small-molecule pentacene and inorganic
   nanoparticle semiconductors in order to integrate TFTs suitable for
   flexible electronics. Moreover, a technique for integration with a
   submicron resolution suitable for glass and foil substrates is
   presented.}},

   Male Circumcision Services in Iringa and Njombe Regions, Tanzania}},

Abstract = {{Interactive GIS maps created by overlapping facility data including
   roads and infrastructure with population and service delivery data
   permitted strategic deployment of mobile voluntary medical male
   circumcision (VMMC) services to underserved rural communities. The
   percentage of VMMCs performed in rural areas jumped from 48\% in 2011 to
   93\% in 2014.
   Background: Based on the established protective effect of voluntary
   medical male circumcision (VMMC) in reducing female-to-male HIV
   transmission, Tanzania's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW)
   embarked on the scale-up of VMMC services in 2009. The Maternal and
   Child Health Integrated Project (MCHIP) supported the MOHSW to roll out
   VMMC services in Iringa and Njombe, 2 regions of Tanzania with among the
   highest HIV and lowest circumcision prevalence. With ambitious targets
   of reaching 264,990 males aged 10-34 years with VMMC in 5 years,
   efficient and innovative program approaches were necessary.
   Program Description: Outreach campaigns, in which mobile teams set up
   temporary services in facilities or non-facility settings, are used to
   reach lesser-served areas with VMMC. In 2012, MCHIP began using
   geographic information systems (GIS) to strategically plan the location
   of outreach campaigns. MCHIP gathered geocoded data on variables such as
   roads, road conditions, catchment population, staffing, and
   infrastructure for every health facility in Iringa and Njombe. These
   data were uploaded to a central database and overlaid with various
   demographic and service delivery data in order to identify the VMMC
   needs of the 2 regions.
   Findings: MCHIP used the interactive digital maps as decision-making
   tools to extend mobile VMMC outreach to ``the last kilometer.{''} As of
   September 2014, the MOHSW with MCHIP support provided VMMC to 267,917
   men, 259,144 of whom were men were aged 10-34 years, an achievement of
   98\% of the target of eligible males in Iringa and Njombe. The project
   reached substantially more men through rural dispensaries and non-health
   care facilities each successive year after GIS was introduced in 2012,
   jumping from 48\% of VMMCs performed in rural areas in fiscal year 2011
   to 88\% in fiscal year 2012 and to 93\% by the end of the project in
   2014.
   Conclusion: GIS was an effective tool for making strategic decisions
   about where to prioritize VMMC service delivery, particularly for mobile
   and outreach services. Donors may want to consider funding mapping
   initiatives that support numerous interventions across implementing
   partners to spread initial start-up costs.}},

Abstract = {{A plethora of nanostructures with outstanding properties have emerged
   over the past decades. Measuring their mechanical properties and
   understanding their deformation mechanisms is of paramount importance
   for many of their device applications. To address this need innovative
   experimental techniques have been developed, among which a promising one
   is based upon microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This article
   reviews the recent advances in MEMS platforms for the mechanical
   characterization of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures over the past
   decade. A large number of MEMS platforms and related nanomechanics
   studies are presented to demonstrate the unprecedented capabilities of
   MEMS for nanoscale mechanical characterization. Focusing on key design
   considerations, this article aims to provide useful guidelines for
   developing MEMS platforms. Finally, some of the challenges and future
   directions in the area of MEMS-enabled nanomechanical characterization
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses how methodological approaches relying on video
   can be included in literacy research to capture changing literacies. In
   addition to arguing why literacy is best studied in context, we provide
   empirical examples of how small, head-mounted video cameras have been
   used in two different research projects that share a common aim:
   understanding the complex ways in which literacy is a part of school
   practices. The complexity of literacy practices taking place in
   classrooms, where students draw on a number of texts for a variety of
   purposes and different literacy discourses co-exist in the same setting,
   poses a serious challenge for those who wish to study literacy in
   educational settings. The methodology presented in this article is our
   attempt to meet this challenge. Our approach relies on using video
   equipment in innovative ways to capture multiple perspectives, involving
   research participants in the data collection process and the early
   stages of analysis, and analysing video data with digital coding
   software. These methods are combined to obtain a more systematic and
   detailed insight into the contexts in which literacy takes place.}},

Abstract = {{The academy in which we toil is moving rapidly towards a greater role
   for online delivery of higher education, and both fans and skeptics
   offer strong reasons to believe this technological shock will have
   substantial disruptive effects on faculty. How can we as economic
   educators continue to provide sufficient value-added to justify our role
   in a world where much of what we now do is effectively being automated
   and commoditized? In this brave new online world, many successful and
   resilient faculty will add value (and differentiate their product) not
   by producing costly and elaborate multimedia lectures in which they
   become a superstar professor-celebrity, but rather through careful,
   clever, and innovative choices regarding both the adoption of the online
   content of other providers and the forms of online interactions they
   integrate into their course designs. Possible forms of
   faculty-to-student and student-to-student interactions run the digital
   gamut from discussion boards and electronic testing to peer assessments,
   games and simulations, and virtual office hours. This article explores
   basic descriptive and prescriptive questions economic educators and
   their administrators are likely to face as the online education tide
   rises. For example, how much does it cost to develop online content and
   how much time does it take? What are the key ``ingredients{''} for a
   pedagogically sound online course? Throughout, I will draw on both the
   extant literature as well as my own experience at the University of
   California, Irvine, where the online evolution is advancing rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{New forms of implicit consumer collaborations in online communities and
   social networks influence demand preferences as consumers themselves
   increasingly participate in creating cultural products that both
   complements and competes with firm offerings. Although research findings
   on these issues vary, strong evidence from both theoretical and
   empirical work suggests that the increased technology affordance on the
   consumer side challenges the profitability of conventional producer
   strategies that are based on pushing product designs that serve large
   segments of consumers while ignoring the service of more nuanced
   consumer preferences. In this study, we present a market design in which
   producers create and sell original digital culture product and, examine
   the effect of consumer co-creation in the presence of consumer sharing
   (piracy) on market performance in terms of consumer and producer surplus
   and consumer choice. Using the methods of experimental economics, we
   find strong interaction effects between consumer sharing and
   co-creation, and, more specifically, we find that consumer sharing
   interacts with consumer-based co-creation and increases product variety
   and consumer surplus while reducing producer benefits from co-creation.}},

Abstract = {{When humanitarian workers embark on learning and dialogue for linking
   geoinformation to disaster management, the activities they confront are
   usually more difficult than interesting. How to accelerate the
   acquisition and deployment of skills and tools for spatial data
   collection and analysis, given the increasingly unmanageable workload of
   humanitarians? How to engage practitioners in experiencing the value and
   limitations of newly available tools? This paper offers an innovative
   approach to immerse disaster managers in geoinformation: participatory
   games that enable stakeholders to experience playable system dynamic
   models linking geoinformation, decisions and consequences in a way that
   is both serious and fun. A conceptual framework outlines the foundations
   of experiential learning through gameplay, with clear connections to a
   well-established risk management framework. Two case studies illustrate
   this approach: one involving flood management in the Zambezi river in
   southern Africa through the game UpRiver (in both physical and digital
   versions), and another pertaining to World Bank training on open data
   for resilience that combines applied improvisation activities with the
   need to understand and deploy software tools like Open Street Map and
   InaSAFE to manage school investments and schoolchildren evacuation in a
   simulated flood scenario for the city of La Plata, Argentina.}},

   the project ``Courting Catastrophe? Humanitarian Policy and Practice in
   a Changing Climate{''}. The game UpRiver was developed with Eric Gordon,
   Stephen Walter, and Wade Kimbrough from the Engagement Lab at Emerson
   College, in collaboration with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre
   and the Zambia Red Cross. The second case study is the result of a
   collaboration with the Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) at
   the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR),
   including Emma Phillips, John Crowley, Vivien Deparday, Robert Soden,
   and Yewondwossen Assefa. The flood model outputs used in that activity
   were provided by Pablo Romanazzi of the Hydrology Lab at Universidad
   Nacional de La Plata. The game ``Negotiating Data{''} was adapted from a
   design by Bettina Koelle of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.
   The use of the game ``Snap!{''} for wordcloud visualization was adapted
   from an idea by Paul Z. Jackson of the Applied Improvisation Network,
   and implemented thought a collaboration with the MIT Game Lab. Janot
   Mendler de Suarez played a key role in formulating the game-enabled
   approach for disaster risk management. A sincere thank you to all these
   colleagues for their support and inspiration, as well as to three
   anonymous reviewers for suggesting ways to greatly improve an earlier
   manuscript. Usual disclaimers apply.}},

Abstract = {{As soon as bovine spermatozoa reach the oviduct they form a sperm
   reservoir Only if a successful interaction and communication between
   sperm and oviduct take place the spermatozoa will stay vital in the
   oviduct for 3-4 days in order to successfully fertilize the oocyte.
   Innovative imaging technologies such as live cell imaging using a
   digital videomicroscopic analysis system for the first time enable to
   investigate these events in a qualitative and quantitative way under
   near in vivo conditions and in real-time. The present manuscript
   provides an overview on the most recent insights of sperm-oviduct
   interaction and their clinical applications. At the same time the
   importance of the oviduct for successful fertilization and pregnancy is
   emphasized. An in depth understanding of sperm-oviduct interaction is
   pivotal for the establishment of new diagnostic and therapeutic concepts
   for treatment of subfertility a decisive prerequisite for a further
   improvement of breeding success in bovine assisted reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing body of literature that explores the increasingly
   blurred divide separating production and consumption. Within this stream
   of work, digital environments are commonly depicted as sites of consumer
   empowerment, participation, co-creation and prosumption, the intertwined
   process of production and consumption. Yet, in response to the mounting
   commercial and legal pressures, Web 2.0 companies pro-actively regulate
   prosumption, deploying advanced technological devices and innovative
   contractual arrangements. Exploring the case of Warner Music Group
   lockdown on YouTube, we investigate the role of a content-sharing
   platform in (re) formatting prosumption. We draw from prosumption theory
   and Ritzer's ``prosumption continuum{''} to highlight how shifting
   arrangements of rights and content regulation shape prosumption of
   corporate content (in our case music owned by record labels). In
   contrast to the studies emphasizing the blurring of the line between
   consumer and producer, we illustrate how prosumption can also be
   transformed (back) into more conventional forms of consumption and
   production. We highlight several mechanisms that make this process of
   ``de-prosumption{''} possible despite considerable consumer opposition,
   and consider the implications facing prosumers of corporate content.

Abstract = {{The introduction of mobile payments is one of many innovations that are
   changing the payment market. This change involves new payment service
   providers entering this lucrative market, and meanwhile, the existing
   stakeholders are trying to defend their oligopolistic positions. The
   mobile payment market cooperation (MPMC) framework in this article shows
   how the digitalization of payments, as a technology innovation, affects
   the competition and collaboration among traditional and new stakeholders
   in the payment ecosystem at three levels of analysis. We do this by
   integrating theories of market cooperation with the literatures on
   business and technology ecosystems. The MPMC framework depicts
   technology-based market cooperation strategies in the context of recent
   battles in the mobile payments ecosystem. In these battles, the
   competitors can use technology either in defensive build-and-defend
   strategies to protect market position, or in offensive battering-ram
   strategies for ecosystem entry or position improvement. Successful
   strategies can lead to: (1) Ricardian rents, based on operational
   efficiency advantages traceable to the firm's position relative to
   suppliers and monopoly power; and (2) Bainian rents, resulting from the
   extent the firm is able to resist price competition in the market. We
   validate the framework that we propose through three case studies of
   technology-based market cooperation in the mobile payments ecosystem.

Abstract = {{The past twenty years have been a time of many new technological
   developments, changing business practices, and interesting innovations
   in the financial information system (IS) and technology landscape. They
   have led to the increasing use of prior innovations that have supported
   e-commerce, and that are now being brought into financial services to
   support different kinds of improvements to core business processes. This
   research examines recent changes in the payment sector in financial
   services, specifically related to mobile payments (m-payments) that
   enable new channels for consumer payments for goods and services
   purchases, and other forms of economic exchange. We extend recent
   research on technology ecosystems and paths of influence analysis for
   how industry-centered technology innovations arise and evolve. We
   explore the extent to which they can be understood through the lens of
   several simple building blocks, including technology components,
   technology-based services, and the technology-supported infrastructures
   that provide foundations for the related digital businesses. Our
   extension of the prior research focuses on two key elements: (1)
   modeling the impacts of competition and cooperation on different forms
   of innovations in the aforementioned building blocks; and (2)
   representing the role that regulatory forces play in driving or delaying
   innovation in the larger scope of our modeling approach. To assess the
   efficacy of our approach, we use it to retrospectively analyze the past
   two decades of innovations in the m-payments space. Our results identify
   the industry-specific patterns of innovation that have occurred, suggest
   how they have been affected by competition, cooperation and regulation,
   and point out some more universal patterns of technology innovations
   that offer insights into the development of e-commerce. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The role of social innovations in transforming the lives of individuals
   and communities has been a source of popular attention in recent years.
   This article systematically reviews the available evidence of the
   relationship between social innovation and its promotion of health
   equity. Guided by Fair Foundations: The VicHealth framework for health
   equity and examining four types of social innovation-social movements,
   service-related social innovations, social enterprise and digital social
   innovations-we find a growing literature on social innovation
   activities, but inconsistent evaluative evidence of their impacts on
   health equities, particularly at the socio-economic, political and
   cultural level of the framework. Distinctive characteristics of social
   innovations related to the promotion of health equity include the
   mobilization of latent or unrealised value through new combinations of
   (social, cultural and material) resources; growing bridging social
   capital and purposeful approaches to linking individual knowledge and
   experience to institutional change. These have implications for health
   promotion practice and for research about social innovation and health
   equity.}},

Abstract = {{In 2007 a prominent British alternative-rock band, Radiohead,
   pre-released its album In Rainbows online, and asked their fans to
   ``pick-their-own-price{''} (PYOP) for the digital download. The offer
   was available during an 8-week window, soon after which the digital and
   CD albums were commercialized at pre-set prices. In this paper, we use
   weekly music sales data in the US between 2004 and 2012 to examine the
   effect of Radiohead's innovative strategy on the subsequent sales of the
   band's albums. We find that Radiohead's PYOP offer had no significant
   impact on CD album sales. Interestingly, it yielded a higher percentage
   change in the digital album sales compared what would have been obtained
   with a conventional release. This suggests that the increase in sales
   due to the vast media attention generated by the offer strategy must
   have dominated the cannibalization effect. Consequently, the PYOP offer
   had a positive impact on sales revenues, even if one assumes no revenues
   were obtained directly from the PYOP downloads. However, this ``success
   story{''} does not readily apply to similar strategies adopted by other
   bands. We show that Nine Inch Nail's free provision of its new album,
   The Slip, decreased digital album sales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Computerized Dead-Space Volume Measurement of Face Masks Applied to
   Simulated Faces}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1247-1251}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The dead-space volume (V-D) of face masks for metered-dose
   inhaler treatments is particularly important in infants and young
   children with asthma, who have relatively low tidal volumes. Data about
   V-D have been traditionally obtained from water displacement
   measurements, in which masks are held against a flat surface. Because,
   in real life, masks are placed against the face, V-D is likely to differ
   considerably between masks depending upon their contour and fit. The aim
   of this study was to develop an accurate and reliable way to measure V-D
   electronically and to apply this technique by comparing the electronic
   V-D of commonly available face masks. METHODS: Average digital faces
   were obtained from 3-dimensional images of 270 infants and children.
   Commonly used face masks (small and medium) from various manufacturers
   (Monaghan Medical, Pari Respiratory Equipment, Philips Respironics, and
   InspiRx) were scanned and digitized by means of computed tomography.
   Each mask was electronically applied to its respective digital face, and
   the V-D enclosed (mL) was computerized and precisely measured. RESULTS:
   V-D varied between 22.6 mL (SootherMask, InspiRx) and 43.1 mL (Vortex,
   Pari) for small masks and between 41.7 mL (SootherMask) and 71.5 mL
   (AeroChamber, Monaghan Medical) for medium masks. These values were
   significantly lower and less variable than measurements obtained by
   water displacement. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized techniques provide an
   innovative and relatively simple way of accurately measuring the V-D of
   face masks applied to digital faces. As determined by computerized
   measurement using average-size virtual faces, the InspiRx masks had a
   significantly smaller V-D for both small and medium masks compared with
   the other masks. This is of considerable importance with respect to
   aerosol dose and delivery time, particularly in young children. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In the era of accelerating digitization and advanced big data analytics,
   harnessing quality data for designing and delivering state-of-the-art
   services will enable innovative business models and management
   approaches (Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014) and
   yield an array of consequences. Among other consequences, digitization
   and big data analytics reshape business models and impact employment
   amongst knowledge workers - just as automation did for manufacturing
   workers. This Viewpoint paper considers the mechanisms underlying how
   digitization and big data analytics drive the transformation of business
   and society and outlines the potential effects of digitization and big
   data analytics on employment - especially in the context of cognitive
   tasks. Its aim is to outline a critical research agenda to explore and

Abstract = {{The Information Systems (IS) field has never been more relevant as
   digital innovations are emerging at a rapid pace fuelled by recombinant
   innovations based on digital infrastructures, advanced middle-ware
   layers, and mobile and ubiquitous technologies. This paper argues, based
   on a bibliometric study of the representation of a mobile ICT discourse
   within the AIS Senior Scholars' `basket' of eight IS journals over the
   past 15 years, that the field needs to become much more academically
   agile. The study showed that a mere 3.2\% of all papers published during
   this period had any relationship to one of the key technological
   phenomena in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The paper
   formulates the hypothesis that the relative shift in impact between
   European- and US-based journals within the `basket of 8' could have been
   influenced by editorial strategising to further encourage academic
   agility exploring new horizons rather than emphasis on further
   exploitation of existing ground. The paper, further argues that the IS
   field seems to more readily engage in a debate of phenomena involving
   centralised and organisationally-bound technological innovations whereas
   distributed, decentralised and infrastructural discourses find it much
   more difficult to gain a foothold. So, whilst the IS field may still be
   stuck in the mainframe age, it needs to move beyond in order to fully
   engage with the world we live in. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, we deal with software radio in an original manner,
   emphasizing the fact that software radio is a major evolution of radio
   technologies and a convergence of different pre-existing fields. Joseph
   Mitola deserves credit for formalizing and conceptualizing this
   evolution. We do not define software radio. Rather, we look at software
   radio from different perspectives. New equipments include more and more
   software radio ``capacities,{''} that is, they can be reconfigured
   thanks to software. Certain former analog functionalities are now
   performed digitally. We think that the timeframe during which software
   radio is advantageous, compared to a velcro(1) approach for
   multi-standard terminals, is probably over. However, software radio has
   taken concrete form in the military field. We show that software radio
   is used de facto in all equipment and products because of the
   technological progress to which it has led. Software radio's legacy
   indeed is that it has been and still is a catalyst for wireless
   innovation. We conclude by showing that software radio will be used to
   its full potential when it is the support technology for other more
   complex fields such as cognitive radio.}},

Title = {{New approach in paediatric dentistry: ultrasonic nondestructive
   evaluation of restorative dental materials. Experimental study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Aim The ultrasonic inspection is a non invasive method which is very
   developed in the industrial field, for the non-destructive evaluation of
   materials, and in the medical field, for the ultrasound diagnostic
   analysis. In paediatric dentistry the most widely used non-destructive
   evaluation is the X-ray technique. Radiographs are valuable aids in the
   oral health care of infants, children, adolescents, allowing dentists to
   diagnose and treat oral diseases that cannot be detected during a visual
   clinical examination. The aim of this in vitro study was to analyse the
   ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (UT-NDE) technique to inspect both
   dental materials internal structure and the form and position of
   internal defects in order to obtain a diagnostic method; free of
   ionising radiations; in paediatric dentistry. Moreover the ultrasonic
   inspection (UT) could be a rapid method Of diagnosis in uncooperative
   paediatric patients.
   Materials and methods Study design: Experimental samples were
   manufactured with the characteristics of a large composite or glass
   ionomer cement paediatric dental restoration, in terms of either size or
   Operative technique used. Characteristics Of the common restorations
   were analysed and reproduced in vitro, using the same operative
   conditions, also adding operative defects into some samples. All the
   samples were subjected to an innovative UT test using the pulse echo
   immersion scanning technique. Both C-scans and full volume scans were
   carried out; during the experimental programme. To enhance the data
   obtained from the UT scan, a digital system (Ecus Inspection software)
   for signal detection, archiving, processing and displaying was used.
   Results UT images showed the presence of internal defects in the dental
   materials. It was also possible to inspect very thin discontinuity such
   as the one represented by the fluid resin. Statistics: In order to
   execute the statistical analysis, the values of electric voltage
   measured in five higher white points and in five higher grey points of
   the pictures pixels, were measured for each Sample. Then, the average
   values and the Standardised data were calculated.
   Conclusion In conclusion, the ultrasonic test could be a diagnostic
   non-invasive method in paediatric patients, capable to evaluate the
   quality of the restorative teeth filling, showing internal little
   defects. In vivo application of this diagnostic method Should be
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experiment that visualizes the permeation of
   chemical grout in transparent soil. The low initial viscosity (5 mPa .
   s) urea-formaldehyde resin (UFR) was chosen as grouting material in this
   experiment. The transparent soil used in this study is made of fused
   silica and a calcium bromide solution with the same refractive index.
   Triaxial and permeability tests are carried out to demonstrate that the
   geotechnical properties and hydraulic permeability of this transparent
   soil are typical of granular soils and suitable for modeling natural
   sand in permeation problem. A combined grouting and optical measurement
   system is developed for this study, which consists of an air pressure
   driven grout injection station to inject grout into a transparent soil
   model, laser to illuminate the cross-section of interest inside the
   model, and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to capture a series of
   images during the whole grout injection and permeation process. Image
   processing techniques including digital image correlation (DIC) are
   applied to sequence of images to detect the edges of the grout bulb and
   displacement distribution. The relationship of the grouting radius and
   grouting time corresponds to Maag's formula on permeation grouting. As a
   result, the validity of this innovative experiment has been verified.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The added value of information and communications
   technologies should be demonstrated precisely in such areas of care in
   which the importance of intersectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation
   is particularly high. In the context of the accompanying research of a
   supply concept for palliative care patients, the potential of a digital
   documentation process was comparatively analysed with the conventional
   paper-based workflow.
   Methods: Data were collected in the form of a multi-methodological
   approach and processed for the project in 3 stages: (1) Development and
   analysis of a palliative care process with the focus on all relevant
   steps of documentation. (2) Questionnaire design and the comparative
   mapping of specific process times. (3) Sampling, selection, and analysis
   of patient records and their derivable insights of process iterations.
   Results: With the use of ICT, the treatment time per patient is reduced
   by up to 53 \% and achieves a reduction in costs and workload by up to
   901 min. The result of an up to 213 \% increase in the number of patient
   contacts allows a higher continuity of care. Although the 16 \% increase
   in documentation loyalty improves the usability of cross-team documented
   information, it partially extends the workload on the level of
   individual actors. By using a digital health record around 31 \% more
   patients could be treated with the same staffing ratio.
   Conclusions: The multi-stage analysis of the palliative care process
   showed that ICT has a decisive influence on the process dimension of
   intersectoral cooperation. Due to favourable organisational conditions
   the pioneering work of palliative care also provides important guidance
   for a successful use of ICT technologies in the context of innovative
   forms of care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a digital active electrode (DAE) system for
   multi-parameter biopotential signal acquisition in portable and wearable
   devices. It is built around an IC that performs analog signal processing
   and digitization with the help of on-chip instrumentation amplifiers, a
   12 bit ADC and a digital interface. Via a standard (IC)-C-2 bus, up to
   16 digital active electrodes (15-channels) can be connected to a
   commercially available microcontroller, thus significantly reducing
   system complexity and cost. In addition, the DAE utilizes an innovative
   functionally DC-coupled amplifier to preserve input DC signal, while
   still achieving state-of-the-art performance: 60 nV/sqrt(Hz)
   input-referred noise and +/- 350 mV electrode-offset tolerance. A
   common-mode feedforward scheme improves the CMRR of an AE pair from 40
   dB to maximum 102 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers and practitioners are increasingly interested in public
   bicycle share programs (PBSP). Greater PBSP use promotes health benefits
   through increased physical activity yet financial costs and distant
   location of docking stations are barriers to PBSP uptake and reach of
   health promoting amenities is poorer among lesser educated individuals.
   However, lack of awareness of PBSP is the first barrier to overcome.
   This study examined 2-year changes in lack of awareness of a
   transport-related innovation implemented in Spring 2009 in Montreal,
   Canada, namely a PBSP called BIXI (c) as a function of proximity to
   bicycle docking stations and educational attainment As part of a larger
   investigation, a repeated cross-sectional design was used. A sample of
   7011 adults was recruited through random-digit dialling to landline
   telephones in three population surveys: prior to implementation
   (n=2000), after season 1 (n=2502), and after season 2 (n=2509).
   Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations of
   survey periods, proximity to docking stations, and education with lack
   of awareness while controlling for socio-demographic and health
   characteristics. At baseline, lower education and absence of docking
   stations within walking distance were associated with lower likelihood
   of awareness of the PBSP. There was a greater likelihood of being
   PBSP-unaware among those with lower education after season 1
   implementation in comparison to those with higher education (OR=1.60,
   95\%CI: 1.18, 2.19). Those with lower education after season 2
   implementation in neighbourhoods where PBSP was available were more
   likely to be PBSP-unaware in comparison to those with higher education
   in neighbourhoods without PBSP docking stations (OR=1.63, 95\%CI: 1.01,
   2.64). Although lack of awareness decreased over time, greater
   percentages of being PBSP-unaware were observed among those with lower
   education and living in neighbourhoods both with and without PBSP
   docking stations. Despite accessibility of the PBS!' docking stations in
   neighbourhoods, inequalities in awareness persist. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this article we present the results of recent research on R\&D
   investments and productivity in the Italian manufacturing sector. By
   broadening the traditional perspective, which essentially looks at the
   impact of internal R\&D on productivity, we explicitly account for the
   role of spillovers of technology. These have proven to be very pervasive
   and important in supporting the growth of labor productivity, especially
   spillovers originating in high-tech sectors. Since the Italian space
   industry has a significant role in those sectors, well beyond what its
   relatively small size would suggest, we take our results to indicate the
   importance of technological spillovers originating from the space
   industry for the progress of productivity in the Italian manufacturing.
   In the first part of the article we describe, using a conceptual
   framework, well established in the economic literature, how the benefits
   of space investments translate into increases in welfare. This approach
   broadens and hopefully sharpens the usual accounts of the benefits of
   space investments and hints to a potentially large contribution of the
   spillovers. In the second part of the article we present the results of
   an empirical analysis that provides econometric estimates of the
   elasticities of labor productivity to knowledge spillover and R\&D
   stock, based on Italian two-digit manufacturing sector panel data from
   1980 to 2011.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the goals, instruments and characteristics of
   Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) enabled innovations in
   the Brazilian software industry emphasizing technologies, transmitting
   channels, learning processes, and organizational changes required by
   advanced digital tools. The methodology steams from the adaptation of an
   existing taxonomy for our specific purposes and the development of a
   field research in Brazil, with the help of the software Atlas.ti. We
   found that ICTs enabled innovations are not isolated events, since they
   affect existing processes, the relationship with clients and suppliers,
   and require greater integration of organizational functions. Important
   differences were observed due to the firms' size, internationalization
   level, technical capabilities and access to proprietary technology.}},

Abstract = {{Much of our architectural heritage today is built out of unreinforced
   masonry. It is often unclear why historic masonry structures still stand
   when conventional analysis tools have predicted their failure. In order
   to ensure the safety of these existing structures, there is an acute
   need for innovative tools that can accurately analyse their stability.
   Associate Professor Philippe Block, Tom Van Mele and Matthias Rippmann
   of the Block Research Group, part of the Institute of Technology in
   Architecture at ETH Zurich demonstrate how computational form-finding
   methods and design tools for masonry structures that stand in pure
   compression, such as arches and vaults, make it possible to design
   expressive and efficient surface structures that can be built with very
   little or low-quality material. By studying the techniques of medieval
   master builders, the Block Research Group has also developed new ways of
   building with masonry, enhanced by current construction and fabrication
   technologies. These new tools and reinvented construction methods can be
   applied in different contexts: for instance, by studying the structure
   of Gothic cathedrals, they manage to dramatically reduce the use of
   materials in office construction.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Our nation's health care system is changing.
   Nowhere is this more evident than in primary care, where fundamental
   improvements are necessary if we are to achieve the Triple Aim. Such
   improvements are possible if we can put useful and timely information
   into the hands of stakeholders to enable practical decision-making. To
   do this, family medicine and primary care researchers need to (1) build
   on our substantial current research foundation, (2) increase the
   relevance and pace of our research, (3) reconceive the research
   workforce to engage new partners, (4) disseminate findings more rapidly
   into the hands of those who can take action, and (5) build a
   ``question-ready{''} research infrastructure to make this possible.
   Family medicine researchers face exciting opportunities: technical
   capacity to generate and manage large amounts of data; clinic-and
   system-level networks for testing innovations; digital health
   technologies for real-time and asynchronous monitoring and management of
   risk factors and chronic diseases; the know-how to make fast, local
   improvements in our systems of care; partnerships beyond those
   traditionally engaged in research that can multiply our capacity to
   generate new knowledge; and new methods for creating generalizable
   knowledge from the study of local efforts. This is a historic time for
   family medicine research. Now is the time to build on our past work,
   accelerate the pace, and capitalize on emerging opportunities that open
   an incredibly bright future.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how sixth-grade students navigated and perceived a
   combined e-book and audiobook reading experience using Kindle Fires.
   While audiobooks and e-books are not new, little is known about
   students' use and perceptions of the combination of these two media, as
   the ability to synchronize audio contents with digital texts is rather
   innovative. In this study, students used e-book tools and features to
   customize the reading experience to suit individual needs. They also
   utilized Immersion Reading to listen to a professional narration and

Abstract = {{As multinational manufacturing companies pursue service innovation
   toward global markets, their back-end development units headquarters
   R\&D-face immense challenges due to market heterogeneity. Our extensive
   studies of 13 leading multinational companies in service innovation have
   identified, analyzed, and ranked challenges to reveal the key steps to
   building necessary capabilities. Based on our analysis, we inductively
   identified four competencies in global service innovation capabilities
   (developing customer insights, integrating global knowledge, creating
   global service offerings, and building a digitalization capability) and
   the activities associated with them. Global service innovation requires
   companies to develop capabilities that support increased relationship
   intensity and interaction between headquarters R\&D and local units,
   customers, and service partners. In developing these capabilities, the
   headquarters units progressively learn to collaborate, integrate, and
   orchestrate processes and activities across and within regional
   front-end units, customers, and service partners.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Article: Tandem Robotic Technique of Extralevator
   Abdominoperineal Excision and Rectus Abdominis Muscle Harvest for
   Immediate Closure of the Pelvic Floor Defect}},
Journal = {{DISEASES OF THE COLON \& RECTUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{885-891}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   Extralevator abdominoperineal excision for distal rectal cancers
   involves cylindrical excision of the mesorectum with wide division of
   the levator ani muscles. Although this technique has been shown to
   decrease local cancer recurrence and improve survival, it leaves the
   patient with a considerable pelvic floor defect that may require
   reconstruction.
   OBJECTIVE:
   We developed an innovative technique of robotic extralevator
   abdominoperineal excision combined with robotic harvest of the rectus
   abdominis muscle flap for immediate reconstruction of the pelvic floor
   defect.
   DESIGN:
   This was a retrospective review pilot study.
   SETTING:
   This study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center.
   PATIENTS:
   Three patients who underwent robotic extralevator abdominoperineal
   excision with robotic rectus abdominis flap harvest for distal rectal
   adenocarcinoma were included.
   MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES:
   Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes included operative time,
   intraoperative complications, length of hospital stay, wound
   complications, incidence of perineal hernia, persistent pain, and
   functional limitations.
   RESULTS:
   Three patients underwent this procedure. The median operative time was
   522 minutes with median hospital stay of 6 days. One patient experienced
   perineal wound complication requiring limited incision and drainage
   followed by complete healing of the wound by secondary intention. The
   other 2 patients did not experience any wound complications. Longest
   follow-up was 16 months. None of the patients developed perineal hernias
   during this time period.
   LIMITATIONS:
   The small sample size and retrospective nature were limitations.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   This technique confers multiple advantages including improved
   visualization and dexterity within the pelvis and accurate wide margins
   at the pelvic floor. An incisionless robotic flap harvest with
   preservation of the anterior rectus sheath obviates the risk of ventral
   hernia while providing robust tissue closure of the radiated
   abdominoperineal excision wound. This technique may result in faster
   postoperative recovery, decreased morbidity, improved functional
   outcomes and cosmesis. Further studies are needed to prospectively
   analyze this approach (Supplemental Digital Content 1, video abstract,
   http://links.lww.com/DCR/A188).}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a paradigmatic analysis of digital application
   marketplaces for advancing information systems research on digital
   platforms and ecosystems. We refer to the notion of digital application
   marketplace, colloquially called `appstores,' as a platform component
   that offers a venue for exchanging applications between developers and
   end users belonging to a single or multiple ecosystems. Such
   marketplaces exhibit diversity in features and assumptions, and we
   propose that examining this diversity, and its ideal types, will help us
   to further understand the relationship between application marketplaces,
   platforms, and platform ecosystems. To this end, we generate a typology
   that distinguishes four kinds of digital application marketplaces:
   closed, censored, focused, and open marketplaces. The paper also offers
   implications for actors wishing to make informed decisions about their
   relationship to a particular digital application marketplace.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of an ecosystem suggests a holistic framing of how
   heterogeneous actors relate to one another and of the dynamics of their
   relationships. Because of the dynamics some relationships will become
   uncertain, posing significant challenge to the identity of participating
   organizations. Unfortunately, the Information Systems (IS) literature
   has not examined how organizations develop and negotiate their
   identities during ecosystem evolution. We fill this void by exploring
   identity challenges that Swedish Road Administration (SRA) faced while
   implementing the Radio Data System - Traffic Message Channel (RDS - TMC)
   traffic information service. Through a longitudinal case study we follow
   how SRA's inherited expectations, guiding norms, and standards of
   sense-giving about its identity prevented it from becoming a flexible
   service provider within an emerging mobile ecosystem. We record a
   constant clash - the identity tension - between the old inherited
   identity of a public road administrator and the aspiring new identity of
   a digital service provider. To enact a successful identity change, SRA
   had to engage in a series of change episodes whereby it deliberately
   implemented new routines that forged novel relationships with actors
   within the ecosystem. This permitted SRA to gradually align its identity
   to the evolving needs of the RDS-TMC service ecosystem. Our findings
   suggest that deliberate attempts to implement innovative mobile services
   - especially those involving public-private partnerships - trigger
   intriguing identity ambiguities and role dilemmas, and future research
   should therefore focus on effective strategies to identify, manage, and
   resolve inherent identity tensions.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of digital multimedia devices in a modern day household
   capable of connecting to the Internet has increased dramatically over
   the last years, including mobile devices such as smart phones and
   tablets as well as digital TV sets and set-top boxes. Since these
   devices are readily available and allow customization through software
   they can be easily used to support and enhance traditional social
   activities in the living room. This paper presents an integrated
   environment of mobile devices and digital TVs connected to the Internet
   used as a platform for exploring both traditional and novel gaming
   concepts in either a single living room or across different homes
   connecting multiple living rooms. To create such an environment a
   framework was developed enabling the implementation of distributed
   social games, using the digital TV as a display showing game content
   public to all players and using the available personal mobile devices as
   controllers and displays showing private portions of the game. The
   framework also allows the innovative use of broadcast related
   information and social media during game play. Five different games were
   developed using the framework. The framework effectiveness was evaluated
   by comparing TV-centric games developed with and without the framework
   using size and complexity metrics, additionally application
   responsiveness was measured using a game developed without and with the
   framework and compared with a state-of-the-art game controller. The
   experience of playing the developed games was obtained by collecting and
   analyzing self-reported data using a questionnaire combined with
   additional observations from volunteers and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing spreads and morphs quickly, shaping areas as diverse as
   creating, organizing, and sharing knowledge; producing digital
   artifacts; providing services involving tangible assets; or monitoring
   and evaluating. Crowdsourcing as sourcing by means of global search'
   yields four types of values for sourcing actors: creative expertise,
   critical items, execution capacity, and bargaining power. It accesses
   cheap excess capacities at the work realm's margins, channeling them
   toward production. Provision and utilization of excess capacities
   rationalize society while intimately connecting to a broader societal
   trend twisting consumers' and producers' roles: leading toward working
   consumers' and consuming producers' and shifting power toward the
   latter. Similarly, marketers using crowdsourcing's look and feel to
   camouflage traditional approaches to bringing consumers under control
   preserve producer power.}},

Abstract = {{The authors consider how a change in product form impacts the adoption
   decision for an innovative product based on digital technology. Examples
   of changes in product form often arise in products that feature indirect
   network externalities, such as MP3 players, PDAs and e-readers. Existing
   research suggests that, for innovations with indirect network
   externalities, the consumer's hardware adoption decision is influenced
   by the availability of complementary products. However, these studies of
   complementary products tend to focus on products that exist only as
   complementary products, such as DVDs, CDs, and video games. This
   research focuses on the case of an innovative hardware product that uses
   digital complementary products that compete with standalone versions of
   the same products. The authors argue that high levels of experience with
   a standalone product that competes with an innovative hardware/software
   bundle should increase the consumer's appreciation of (1) the
   utilitarian benefits of the hardware/software bundle and (2) the hedonic
   benefits of the standalone product, some of which may not be
   transferable to the electronic hardware. An analysis of data collected
   from 549 potential adopters of e-readers in Japan support these
   hypotheses. The findings have important implications for the design and
   marketing of digital innovations that involve a change in product form.}},

Abstract = {{``This paper describes a new and innovative measure that is developed to
   predict workplace deviance through the measurement of Machiavellianism
   and Compliant Behavior. Two field studies were conducted to study the
   validity of the digital work simulation. In Study 1, (N = 113) support
   was found for the construct validity of the simulation. The constructs
   as measured with the simulation correlated significantly with
   self-reported measures of the constructs and were related to personality
   and self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 285) examined the criterion-related
   validity of the simulation and showed that through the assessment of
   Machiavellianism the simulation was able to predict workplace deviance,
   and incrementally predicted organizational deviance over and above the
   Machiavellianism Personality Scale. Machiavellianism as measured with
   the simulation was less susceptible to social desirable answering
   compared to the Machiavellianism self-report. The paper finishes with
   study limitations, future research directions, and practical
   implications.}},

Abstract = {{Customer expectations for government services have changed significantly
   in the past decade, at the same time as technology, especially social
   media, has transformed how agencies interact with their customers and
   deliver services. These transformed expectations and interactions have
   created a perception gap about service delivery and are challenging
   agencies to respond quicker, be more transparent about programs and
   processes, and provide a better overall customer experience. This
   article uses the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) in the
   District of Columbia as a case study of how one agency developed a
   strategy to address this perception gap. The strategy is based on a
   three pronged approach: rebalancing the workload to be less reactive,
   reducing the amount of reactive work and the amount coming in through
   customer calls by adopting proactive measures, and rapidly responding to
   service requests. The strategy was implemented through a series of
   initiatives including business process enhancements through the infusion
   of technology, adopting a data-based decision making approach,
   innovative contracting, smart asset management, and a better aligned
   communication strategy and proactive customer outreach. DDOT saw
   positive outcomes as a result of these initiatives, including reduced
   service requests, more proactive work, quicker response times, and
   overall increase in customer satisfaction. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectivesAlthough nanosecond-domain lasers have been the
   mainstay of laser tattoo removal for decades, recent disruptive
   innovations in laser design have introduced a new class of commercial
   Q-switched lasers that generate picosecond-domain pulses.
   StudyA picosecond-domain, Nd:YAG laser with a KTP frequency-doubling
   crystal was used to treat 31 decorative tattoos in 21 subjects. Safety
   and effectiveness were determined by blinded evaluation of digital
   images in this prospective clinical study.
   ResultsThe average clearance overall as evaluated by blinded observers
   evaluating randomized digital photographs was 790.9\% (mean +/- sem)
   after an average of 6.5 treatments. Of the 31 tattoos completing
   treatment, 6 had evidence of mild hyper- or hypo-pigmentation by
   evaluation of photographs.
   ConclusionThe 350 picosecond, 532nm, and 450 picosecond 1,064nm Nd:YAG
   laser is safe and effective for removing decorative tattoos. Lasers

Abstract = {{Daylighting has an important role in sustainable architecture as it
   affects the energy consumption in a building. Especially for an office
   building, daylight helps not only to reduce the load on artificial
   lighting but also to promote work efficiency through promoting good
   human health, well-being and user comfort. The objective of this
   research is to develop an innovative facade design strategy that comes
   from the development of digital technology and dynamic daylight
   performance measuring methods. Thus, the various parameters are studied
   through the computational process of cellular automata (CA) to generate
   the several alternative opening patterns on the building facade. Each CA
   design value was tested under static and dynamic sky condition to
   analyze the quality and quantity of daylight and visual comfort
   throughout the year. The results were compared to find an optimum
   alternative design in terms of the daylighting design criteria, from
   building code, standard and design guidelines for the office building.
   Finally, research of an adaptive facade design strategy was concluded
   with the results from the above hybridization of generative and
   performative design methodology. This study discovers the architectural
   design approach from the CA and it will make not only progress in
   building facade esthetics, but also human comfort with building
   sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{In 1972, Edsger Dijkstra claimed that computers had only introduced the
   new problem of learning to use them effectively. This is especially true
   in 2015 with regard to powerful new educational technologies. This
   article describes the challenges that 21st century educational
   technologists are, and will be, addressing as they undertake the
   effective integration of new technologies into K-12 educational systems
   and learning environments. The expanding Internet, ever more powerful
   mobile devices, and other innovations make the task of designing
   effective formal and informal learning challenging, especially in light
   of the high rate of change in these new technologies. While these
   technologies introduce many benefits, they are also causing serious
   threats to system security and personal privacy. Furthermore, as these
   technologies continue to evolve, ethical issues such as equal access to
   resources become imperative. Educational technologists must expand their
   forward-thinking leadership and planning competencies so as to ensure
   effective use of new technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss how iPads offer innovative opportunities for
   early literacy learning but also present challenges for teachers and
   children. We lent iPads to a Children's Centre nursery (3-to
   4-year-olds), a primary school reception class (4-to 5-year-olds) and a
   Special School (7-to 13-year-olds), discussed their potential uses with
   staff in pre- and post-interviews and observed how they were integrated
   into practice over a two-month period. We found variability in the ways
   iPads were used across the settings, but a commonality was that
   well-planned; iPad-based literacy activities stimulated children's
   motivation and concentration. They also offered rich opportunities for
   communication, collaborative interaction, independent learning, and for
   children to achieve high levels of accomplishment. In some cases, this
   led teachers favourably to re-evaluate the children's literacy
   competence, and enabled children to construct positive images of
   themselves in the literacy classroom. Practitioners particularly valued
   the opportunities iPads afforded to deliver curriculum guidelines in new
   ways, and to familiarise all students with touch-screen technologies.}},

   8-year cumulative adoption of the mobile phone in one developing

   digital divide model, age, education, economic condition, Internet
   access, and household size were significant divides in all years;
   employment, marital status, and urbanness were so only in about half the
   years, and sex in none of the years. However, a diffusion of innovations
   approach revealed some differences in demographic influences on mobile
   phone adoption across three adoption categories. Changing mobile phone
   market conditions were associated with varying adoption levels, and
   gross domestic product (GDP) per capita correlated with percent adoption
   except during the global economic crisis.}},

Abstract = {{The online crowdsourcing of ideas for institutional change and
   legislation drafting has been widely adopted by public bodies from the
   local to the international level, for improving legitimacy,
   transparency, and accountability. In multistakeholder set-ups, such an
   approach seems to fulfill the promise of openness, real-time engagement
   and cross-fertilization of ideas. Global Internet policy-making appears
   as a natural experiment for harnessing the potential of crowdsourcing,
   in particular, as a means to restore trust after the Snowden revelations
   of mass surveillance. This article investigates two key initiatives of
   online collective brainstorming for digital policies: ICANN's Strategy
   Panel on Multistakeholder Innovation and the NETmundial process,
   highlighting the merits and limitations of crowdsourcing as an emerging
   form of multistakeholder participation. Our findings underscore the need
   for leveraging sufficient community interest for substantial input;
   defining procedures for the collection and screening of inputs; and
   committing to institutionalizing rules for incorporating feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims to underline that playing video games is a healthy
   activity at least for two reasons: it promotes meaningful learnings and
   fosters healthy lifestyles. The paper is a reflection on a possible
   didactic revolution where among digital technologies; video games are
   the principal instruments that are able to design healthy lifestyles in
   school settings. Scientific and academic research in the educational
   videogame field and their integration into didactic processes is very
   active and offers several challenges that school can't ignore anymore.
   Video games in the didactic field represent one of the most concrete and
   innovative examples in redefining the educational syllabus in school
   systems. Video games also represent strategic teaching tools that allow
   to manage in a creative way even complex problems, such as health
   issues, as they stimulate understanding and encourage exploration.}},

   technologies have great potential to contribute to the quality of
   teacher education, provided there is a theoretical and methodological
   conduct committed to the educational goals, with the time, adequate
   space and resources and that the people involved are engaged in this new

Abstract = {{Despite a large number of existing telemedical applications as well as
   numerous issues in the current implementations, the desire for
   intensified integration of IT solutions for the health sector is
   unanimous amongst all actors involved (patients, practitioners, software
   and hardware developers, insurers, services, etc.). This reflects the
   state of digital systems in use in medicine today which have yet to
   arrive in the 21st century and operate well below the technologically
   possible. Telemedical methods remain mainly associated to flagship
   projects with often limited mid-or long term impact on patient care
   practices or scientific research. Supraregional or national standards
   are far from being defined.
   The register EUSTAR under patronage of the ESH is designed to fill gaps
   in the current IT solutions by utilisation of the innovative software
   system SCITIM (R) to enable broad application of telemedicine and
   thereby provide evidence for its scientific and economical feasibility.
   For this the utilisation of interventional decentralised telemonitoring
   (idTM (R)) is suitable as it preserves clear and direct
   patient-practitioner bonds and communication. The fundamental measure of
   idTM (R) - to judge the quality of the telemedical application by the
   medical quality of the consequent actions - is rarely considered by the
   majority of smaller projects where other telemedical applications and
   methods are established.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   calibrated monolithic illumination meter for monitoring solar radiation
   of tomato crops is newly proposed. The output signal is a pulse stream,
   it could be easily sent over a wide range of transmission media, such as
   package switch network, radio, optical, infrared, ultrasonic, and so on.
   Another innovation is that the proposed calibration method can reduce
   the nonlinear error arising from sun sensors. By collocating with a
   monolithic sun sensor, which has a radiation range of 68.9-188.7 W/m(2),
   the corresponding output frequency ranges from 0.7 to 1.82 MHz. After
   calibration, a measured maximum frequency error is 1.63\%. Measurement
   results have successfully verified all the functions and performance of
   the proposed calibrated monolithic illumination meter and confirmed it
   to be applied on monitoring solar radiation of tomato crops. The
   proposed CMOS calibrated monolithic illumination meter is suitable for
   measuring solar radiation devices, such as the devices for detecting
   solar radiation of crops.}},

Title = {{Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM: Structural simulation with accurate historic BIM

Abstract = {{The complexity of historic constructions, with irregular geometry,
   inhomogeneous materials, variable morphology, alterations and damages,
   poses numerous challenges in the digital modeling and simulation of
   structural performances under different types of actions. Although
   recent developments in Building Information Modeling have introduced
   advanced simulation capabilities, the numerical characterization of
   historic buildings is still a challenging task for the lack of reliable
   procedures for structural simulation.
   This paper presents an innovative two-step methodology
   (Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM) able to convert a historic BIM into a finite
   element model for structural simulation. The generation of the BIM
   (Cloud-to-BIM) is carried out with an accurate survey that integrates
   geometrical aspects, diagnostic analysis based on destructive and
   non-destructive inspections, material information, element
   interconnections, and architectural and structural considerations. The
   BIM is then turned into a finite element model (BIM-to-FEM) with a
   geometric rationalization which preserves irregularities and anomalies,
   such as verticality deviation and variable thickness. After setting
   material properties, loads, and boundary conditions, the structural
   simulation is run with a detailed model that respects the uniqueness and
   authenticity of the historic building, without the typical excessive
   geometric simplifications of the shape.
   A real case study is illustrated and discussed to prove that a rigorous
   Cloud-to-BIM-to-FEM workflow allows the generation of an accurate
   historic BIM from a set of laser scanning point clouds. Structural
   simulation was carried out with a 3D mesh derived from the BIM in order
   to take into consideration the geometrical irregularity of a castle.
   Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach are
   illustrated and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how consumers adopt a state of the art product is
   important for the development and marketing of innovative products. The
   purpose of this study is to examine factors that affect consumer
   intentions to use a revolutionary technology-driven product (RTP). The
   research integrates two innovation adoption models, the Unified
   Technology Acceptance and Utilization Theory (UTAUT) and the
   Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model with two antecedents of consumer
   characteristics: consumer innovativeness and perceived value of a new
   product. The study examines consumer responses to an unfamiliar product,
   the TEASER which is a conceptual digital cookbook that offers taste
   sampling, thereby providing an online food-Lasting experience. Consumers
   who are prone to innovativeness and who perceive value in a RTP's
   aesthetics are able to discern the conditions that support their intent
   to use such a product. The resulting model expands the UTAUT and TIE
   theories by showing that UTAUT variables mediate between the variables
   of TTF and adoption intentions. These results support the need for
   nonlinear industrial development processes involving consumers. (C) 2015

   insights and future research directions}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In the past channel literature has looked to other disciplines
   in developing and refining their theories, models and methods in order
   to evolve the field. This paper traces such history and highlights the
   substantial changes caused by the digital age. In light of this, the
   inclusion of design theory into future channel management is presented
   to overcome existing concerns.
   Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of literature on the
   history of channels, the emotional experience (people), limitations of
   digital innovation (technology) and the role of design (business) has
   been conducted to create a new approach, built upon the theory of the
   techno-economic innovation model.
   Findings: The findings of this study propose design-led channel
   management as a new research area, providing novel research questions
   and future research directions. The inclusion of design and emotion
   theories indicates that the future of digital channel design requires a
   deeper understanding of customers and needs to go beyond technological
   advances.
   Theoretical implications: The findings provide an opportunity to explore
   dynamic theories and methodologies within the field of design that will
   broaden the horizons and challenge existing notions in channel
   literature.
   Originality/value: This paper is the first paper that introduces the
   theory of Ernotionate, as the next evolution of channel literature. The
   value of Emotionate lies in providing a new design led process of
   integrating emotion to provide advice to practitioners as well as
   identifies research areas for academia, thereby extending the reach and
   richness of this emerging research field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   building blocks, this paper defines, describes and illustrates the idea
   of a smart tourism ecosystem (STE). It further draws on
   conceptualizations of smart technologies, smart cities and smart tourism
   to envision new ways in which value is created, exchanged and consumed
   in the STE. Technologies essential to the functioning of an STE are

Abstract = {{Recent advances in training deep (multi-layer) architectures have
   inspired a renaissance in neural network use. For example, deep
   convolutional networks are becoming the default option for difficult
   tasks on large datasets, such as image and speech recognition. However,
   here we show that error rates below 1\% on the MNIST handwritten digit
   benchmark can be replicated with shallow non-convolutional neural
   networks. This is achieved by training such networks using the `Extreme
   Learning Machine' (ELM) approach, which also enables a very rapid
   training time (similar to 10 minutes). Adding distortions, as is common
   practise for MNIST, reduces error rates even further. Our methods are
   also shown to be capable of achieving less than 5.5\% error rates on the
   NORB image database. To achieve these results, we introduce several
   enhancements to the standard ELM algorithm, which individually and in
   combination can significantly improve performance. The main innovation
   is to ensure each hidden-unit operates only on a randomly sized and
   positioned patch of each image. This form of random `receptive field'
   sampling of the input ensures the input weight matrix is sparse, with
   about 90\% of weights equal to zero. Furthermore, combining our methods
   with a small number of iterations of a single-batch backpropagation
   method can significantly reduce the number of hidden-units required to
   achieve a particular performance. Our close to state-of-the-art results
   for MNIST and NORB suggest that the ease of use and accuracy of the ELM
   algorithm for designing a single-hidden-layer neural network classifier
   should cause it to be given greater consideration either as a standalone
   method for simpler problems, or as the final classification stage in

Abstract = {{In this paper, the importance of modern technology in forensic
   investigations is discussed. Recent technological developments are
   creating new possibilities to perform robust scientific measurements and
   studies outside the controlled laboratory environment. The benefits of
   real-time, on-site forensic investigations are manifold and such
   technology has the potential to strongly increase the speed and efficacy
   of the criminal justice system. However, such benefits are only realized
   when quality can be guaranteed at all times and findings can be used as
   forensic evidence in court. At the Netherlands Forensic Institute,
   innovation efforts are currently undertaken to develop integrated
   forensic platform solutions that allow for the forensic investigation of
   human biological traces, the chemical identification of illicit drugs
   and the study of large amounts of digital evidence. These platforms
   enable field investigations, yield robust and validated evidence and
   allow for forensic intelligence and targeted use of expert capacity at
   the forensic institutes. This technological revolution in forensic
   science could ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in which a new role of
   the forensic expert emerges as developer and custodian of integrated
   forensic platforms.}},

Abstract = {{In the digital age, it seems that participation has been conflated with
   literacy, content with engagement, novelty with innovation and ubiquity
   with meaning (e.g. see Thornham and McFarlane, 2014; Gillespie, 2010;
   Dean, 2008; Livingstone, 2009; van Dijck, 2013) and encapsulated in
   terms such as `digital native', `digital divide' or `born digital'. In
   turn, these conflations have done something to technology, which is
   constructed as malleable, a supportive facilitator, and the user, who is
   constructed as active agent. Neither of these account for mediations nor
   for -crucial for us -the notion of the imaginary, which emerges in our
   research as so central to expertise. Drawing on ethnographic work
   carried out in Studio12, a media production facility for young people
   with disadvantaged backgrounds in Leeds, United Kingdom, we propose that
   the concept of expertise emerges through a bigger array of social
   capital as well as traditional structures of power such as class, gender
   and race. Expertise is claimed, evidenced and generated. For us,
   however, expertise emerged not only as elusive but also because it was
   premised on a disjuncture between lived and everyday youth and the
   promises of becoming in a future orientated (technological, imaginary
   and creative) landscape.}},

Journal = {{ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{High-performance concurrent priority queues are essential for
   applications such as task scheduling and discrete event simulation.
   Unfortunately, even the best performing implementations do not scale
   past a number of threads in the single digits. This is because of the
   sequential bottleneck in accessing the elements at the head of the queue
   in order to perform a DeleteMin operation.
   In this paper, we present the SprayList, a scalable priority queue with
   relaxed ordering semantics. Starting from a non-blocking SkipList, the
   main innovation behind our design is that the DeleteMin operations avoid
   a sequential bottleneck by ``spraying{''} themselves onto the head of
   the SkipList list in a coordinated fashion. The spraying is implemented
   using a carefully designed random walk, so that DeleteMin returns an
   element among the first O (p log(3) p) in the list, with high
   probability, where p is the number of threads. We prove that the running
   time of a DeleteMin operation is O (log(3) p), with high probability,
   independent of the size of the list.
   Our experiments show that the relaxed semantics allow the data structure
   to scale for high thread counts, comparable to a classic unordered
   SkipList. Furthermore, we observe that, for reasonably parallel
   workloads, the scalability benefits of relaxation considerably outweigh
   the additional work due to out-of-order execution.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at identifying the factors affecting the intention to
   use personal digital assistant (PDA) technology among physicians in
   Turkey using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A structural
   equation-modeling approach was used to identify the variables that
   significantly affect the intention to use PDA technology. The data were
   collected from 339 physicians in Turkey. Results indicated that 71\% of
   the physicians' intention to use PDA technology is explained by
   perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On comparing both, the
   perceived ease of use has the strongest effect, whereas the effect of
   perceived enjoyment on behavioral intention to use is found to be
   insignificant. This study concludes with the recommendations for
   managers and possible future research.}},

Abstract = {{Culture right have become a newly emerging human rights around the world
   after 1980. From a long term perspective of culture protection, it is
   very important to focus on culture propagation and preservation. Under
   the erosion of mainstream culture, the preservation issue of aboriginal
   culture has become a particular important issue. For the sake, this
   study explores how information technology can be used to effectively
   help preserve, promote and revitalize traditional Formosan aboriginal
   cultures through the implementation of digital archives, which can make
   a culture to be more readily accessible to the general public. To have a
   better understand about what factors prompt users to continually access
   the digital culture archive. This paper first presents an adaptation of
   `Web 2.0' to build a digital archive for the Atayal Culture Museum in
   Taiwan. Then, explores correlations between constructs such as Web 2.0
   site characteristics, media richness, para-social presence, user
   experience, user satisfaction and user intention. The results could be
   useful in developing integrated platforms or tools for educational
   purposes, allowing teachers and students to effectively share and apply
   cultural and educational resources. Another objective is to revitalize
   and commercialize the cultural industry, using the digital archive's
   content as the basis for collaboration with teachers and other relevant
   professionals to achieve maximum creativity and create practical and
   innovative digital learning products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{UK activist group Class War's WAR ON wonga' campaign is viewed via
   Boltanski and Chiapello's critique of capitalism - The New Spirit of
   Capitalism (2005{[}1999]) - namely as a form of social critique. Wonga
   has emerged as the UK's leading payday loan company since it was founded
   in 2007, and should be recognized as a product of the culture of
   financialization. Class War's campaign is a response to the linkage
   between inequality and entrepreneurial capitalism. As an example of
   entrepreneurial capitalism, the possibility of free enterprise, Wonga's
   self-description as an innovative digital company' makes directly
   wealthy the founding entrepreneurs and their current venture capital
   partners. Yet the economic success of Wonga also represents a growing
   inequality in a society of unprecedented wealth. Given the UK
   perspective, the long shadow of Thatcher informs this essay, as does the
   criminalization of debt during the Victorian period.}},

Abstract = {{The recent Pew Forum study, ``'Nones' on the Rise,'' indicates a growing
   percentage of religiously unaffiliated adults in the United States and
   suggests that these individuals do not seek new religions or
   denominations but nontraditional means of exploring spiritual questions,
   facilitating religious practice and finding community. This article
   examines Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment
   (A.R.E.) as a case study for the non-traditional religious affiliation
   and experience of Nones in the twenty-first century. Through staff and
   participant interviews and attention to the current work of the A.R.E.
   at its Virginia Beach headquarters and its summer camp in Rural Retreat,
   Virginia, this article shows how A.R.E. innovation and tradition have
   allowed this organization to reach Nones and embrace the digital age
   even as it advocates approaches to religion and spirituality that have
   deep historical roots in American religious history.}},

Abstract = {{The 3.66 m tall and over nine-ton outdoor bronze sculpture of Alma
   Mater, created by Lorado Taft in 1929, is an iconic symbol of the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The conservation treatment
   of the sculpture came with some unexpected surprises, such as the
   discovery of failing internal ferrous nuts and bolts which needed to be
   replaced. The treatment involved removing the sculpture from its granite
   base, dismantling major elements of the sculpture and replacing the
   ferrous bolts with silicon bronze bolts, laser cleaning the surface with
   1064 nm Q-switch scanning lasers, application of patina, applying a
   protective microcrystalline wax coating, and reinstallation of the
   sculpture. Analysis was performed with microscopy, X-radiography, and
   scanning electron microscopy. The conservation treatment involved
   cutting edge laser technology to remove corrosion from the surface,
   while structured light three-dimensional (3D) scanning and digital
   modeling techniques were used to create a new form of public interaction
   with the sculpture by 3D scanning the sculpture and creating a life like
   3D digital model to create an augmented reality Alma Mater sculpture to
   temporarily take the place of the missing monument. Augmented reality is
   a technology which overlays a digital representation in registration
   with the real world giving the viewer an experience of interacting with
   the digital object as though it was actually present at that location in
   the real world. It is a longstanding tradition for students to have
   their picture taken with the sculpture during graduation, and thanks to
   this innovative use of technology, they were able to get their picture
   taken with a sculpture that was digitally, but not physically, present.
   In addition to receiving information and media related to the
   conservation treatment while it was taking place, the University of
   Illinois community and the class of 2013 was able to experience the
   augmented reality monument generated over the original base. This
   project demonstrates how augmented reality works of art can be used to
   replace the experience of actual objects that are removed from public
   view for conservation treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy and Data security are heating topic in the modern
   technologically advanced economy. Technological Innovations have created
   new forms of electronic data which are more vulnerable to theft or loss
   when compared to traditional data storage. Moreover, the recent advances
   in internet technologies have exacerbated the risk of security threats.
   The Internet brings a whole new set of challenges in terms of data
   protection. Considering the complexities of modern technological
   advancements and its impact on data security, this study examines the
   Irish laws and EU directives for privacy and data security, its
   effectiveness in managing large scale data breaches and limitations.
   This paper also simulates attack scenarios that can be done by anonymous
   users in a complex cyberspace environment and explains how a digital
   evidence related to the attack scenario can be tracked down.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics a large number of
   mutants are available. The discovery of their phenotypes is fast
   becoming the bottleneck of molecular plant physiology. This crisis can
   be overcome by imagingbased phenotyping, an emerging, rapidly developing
   and innovative approach integrating plant and computer science. A
   tremendous amount of digital image data are automatically analysed using
   techniques of `machine vision'. This minireview will shed light on the
   available imaging strategies and discuss standard methods for the
   automated analysis of images to give the non-bioinformatic reader an
   idea how the new technology works. A number of successful platforms will
   be described and the prospects that image-based phenomics may offer for
   elucidating hormonal cross-talk and molecular growth physiology will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to find new equations for a novel
   phase-shifting method in digital photoelasticity. Some innovations are
   proposed. In terms of phase-shifting, only the analyzer is rotated, and
   the other equations are deduced by applying a new numerical technique
   instead of the usual algebraic techniques. This approach can be used to
   calculate a larger sequence of images. Each image represents a pattern
   and a measurement of the stresses present in the object. A reduction in
   the difference between the theoretical and experimental values of
   stresses was obtained by increasing the number of images in the
   equations for calculating phase. Every photographic image has errors and
   random noise, but the uncertainties due to these effects can be reduced
   with a larger number of observations.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare is one of the business fields with the highest Big Data
   potential. According to the prevailing definition, Big Data refers to
   the fact that data today is often too large and heterogeneous and
   changes too quickly to be stored, processed, and transformed into value
   by previous technologies. The technological trends drive Big Data:
   business processes are more and more executed electronically, consumers
   produce more and more data themselves - e.g. in social networks - and
   finally ever increasing digitalization. Currently, several new trends
   towards new data sources and innovative data analysis appear in medicine
   and healthcare. From the research perspective, omics-research is one
   clear Big Data topic. In practice, the electronic health records, free
   open data and the ``quantified self{''} offer new perspectives for data
   analytics. Regarding analytics, significant advances have been made in
   the information extraction from text data, which unlocks a lot of data
   from clinical documentation for analytics purposes. At the same time,
   medicine and healthcare is lagging behind in the adoption of Big Data
   approaches. This can be traced to particular problems regarding data
   complexity and organizational, legal, and ethical challenges. The
   growing uptake of Big Data in general and first best-practice examples
   in medicine and healthcare in particular, indicate that innovative
   solutions will be coming. This paper gives an overview of the potentials
   of Big Data in medicine and healthcare.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental self-driving cars are being tested on public roads, and
   will at some point be commercially sold or made otherwise available to
   the public. A self-driving car and its digital control systems take over
   control tasks previously performed by the human driver. This places high
   demands on this control system which has to perform the highly complex
   task of driving the car through traffic. When this system does not
   perform its task adequately and damage ensues the failure of the control
   system may be used as a stepping stone to claim liability of the
   manufacturer of the car or the control system. Uncertainties about the
   application of (product) liability law may slow down the uptake of
   self-driving cars more than is warranted on the basis of technical
   progress. This article examines how the decision about the timing of a
   market introduction can be approached and how possible chilling effects
   of liability law can be redressed with an adequate system of obligatory
   insurance. (C) 2015 Maurice Schellekens. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Australian psychologists have always been challenged to find innovative
   ways of overcoming the geographical, social, and economic barriers that
   characterise health care across this vast country. With the rapid
   digitalisation of communication globally, psychologists are urged to
   anticipate the ways in which information and communication technology
   will affect our practice in the future and to pro-actively formulate
   ways in which we can meet the changing demands for mental health
   services. Increasingly, research demonstrates that efficacy, clinical
   effectiveness, cost, and satisfaction are roughly equivalent for
   telepsychology as traditional face-to-face interventions. If
   psychologists are to retain a leadership role in the provision of global
   psychological services, it is imperative that we prepare to make
   provision to integrate new technologies into our professional practice.
   This article outlines some barriers and possible strategies to address
   them as we identify future directions for telemental health and the

Abstract = {{From a business perspective, cloud computing has revolutionized the
   information and communication technology (ICT) industry by offering
   scalable and on-demand ICT services as well as innovative pricing plans
   such as pay-per-use and subscription. Considering the economic benefits
   of cloud computing, cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) has been
   proposed as a new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design
   innovation. Although CBDM has the potential to reduce costs associated
   with high performance computing (HPC) and maintaining ICT
   infrastructures in the context of cloud computing, it is challenging to
   justify the potential cost savings associated with design and
   manufacturing because of the complexity in the economic benefit analysis
   of migrating to CBDM. In response, this paper provides important
   insights into the economics of CBDM by identifying key cost factors and
   potential pricing models that can influence decision making on whether
   migrating to the cloud for computationally expensive analyses that are
   commonplace for design and manufacturing (e.g., computer-aided design
   (CAD)/computer-aided engineering (CAE)/computer-aided manufacturing
   (CAM)) is economically justifiable. This work, for the first time,
   identifies the key economic benefits required for a comparative study
   that supports organizations in determining when traditional in-house
   design and manufacturing versus CBDM is most appropriate. Several
   comparative case studies and a hypothetical application example are
   provided to demonstrate and quantitatively validate decision support
   methods. Finally, key issues and road blocks for CBDM are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{We report a case study of two highly qualified science teachers as they
   implemented laptop computers in their Years 9 and 10 science classes at
   the beginning of the `Digital Education Revolution,' Australia's
   national one-to-one laptop program initiated in 2009. When a large-scale
   investment is made in a significant educational change, it is important
   to consider teachers perspectives and responses to such change and we
   draw from sociocultural perspectives for our analysis. Through
   interviews and classroom observations, our interpretive analysis
   identified four key tensions and contradictions. These include the
   following: (1) barriers to innovative science teaching; (2) maintaining
   classroom and school connectivity; (3) teacher versus student
   expectations; and (4) changes to classroom management. Analysis leads to
   implications for the future of this and similar programs. The study
   shows that while these two teachers were committed to developing and
   delivering technology-rich science lessons, there were many factors that
   challenge how the implementation progressed. The findings from this
   study have implications for the continued engagement of teachers in this
   and other jurisdictions considering the introduction of one-to-one
   laptop programs.}},

Abstract = {{The technological innovation has made significant progress that has
   affected almost all industrial technology and computer science areas. In
   the agribusiness sector, and specifically on the production of the
   Persian lemon, the control of product quality is essential; for this
   purpose, detailed information about the morphology and color
   characteristics is required to obtain.
   The aim of this paper is to present an automatic parameterization and
   classification system for agricultural engineering applications with
   easy operation, high mobility and innovative techniques based on digital
   image processing. This system is able to get the color and shape through
   the analysis of morphometric and colorimetric characteristics of Persian
   lemon in a preset scene. The classification system scans the surface of
   a lemon 360 degrees through multistage architecture components. With
   this system, the authors evaluate the morphometric and colorimetric
   variations using statistical data of positioning in the RGB channels of
   an image.
   Practical ApplicationsFor the agricultural industry, it is very
   important to improve the quality of agricultural products. In this
   proposal, the authors present a system for the classification of Persian
   lemons through automatic parameterization and image-processing
   techniques, generating products of highest quality and also facilitating
   energy savings for the industry. Moreover, the image-processing-based
   systems can also be used as a monitoring tool that facilitates visual
   inspection for the classification process, improving the final quality
   of the products and optimizing the manufacturing process.}},

Abstract = {{We present the conceptualization of a foresight support system (FSS),
   which is designed to implement a continuous and embedded foresight
   process among partners of a business cluster. We argue that engaging in
   foresight (1) enables clusters and organizations to face discontinuous
   change, (2) avoids lock-in of business clusters by networking and
   knowledge exploitation and that (3) collaborative foresight can support
   such networking. As systemic instruments that connect stakeholders and
   support continuous foresight processes, FSSs are especially suited to
   achieve these results. We present five basic premises to conceptualize
   an FSS and concretize them by a requirement analysis for an FSS funded
   by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the course
   of Germany's Leading-Edge Cluster Logistics. The requirements lead to
   the conceptualization of a foresight database, a digital future workshop
   application, and a prediction market application integrated in a futures
   platform. All applications are interlinked to support users through a
   guided, web-based, multi-method foresight process. The implementation of
   the FSS in business clusters and insights acquired during the three-year
   project are discussed. Overall, we present insights on how regionally
   implemented foresight contributes to regional innovation systems and
   thereby contribute to the emerging research stream on FSS. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Shifts in technological paradigms simultaneously disrupt existing
   industrial organization and raise opportunities for entrepreneurial
   companies. However, research on technological innovation centers the
   development of new technological solutions, while largely neglecting
   changes in customer problems or needs. This paper develops a typology
   for use as an analytical framework covering technological innovations
   and variations in market demand. The typology is then applied to the
   photographic industry, specifically the development of digital imaging
   technologies which disrupted existing film material and chemistry
   technologies in a paradigm shift from analog film to digital cameras.
   Taking a systematic view of product technologies, the typology
   identifies seven types of technological changes during the photography
   industry's process of digitalization. Case studies show that disruption
   of incumbent competencies can be attributed to the interactive effects
   of technological innovations and variations to market demand. Adaptive
   strategies corresponding to the identified types of technological
   changes are reported and discussed. The proposed typology is designed as
   a generic framework and is validated using an additional set of case
   studies from the media industrial sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A variety of digit and limb repair and reconstruction methods have been
   used in different clinical settings, but regeneration remains an item on
   every plastic surgeon's ``wish list.{''} Although surgical salvage
   techniques are continually being improved, unreplantable digits and
   limbs are still abundant. We comprehensively review the structural and
   functional salvage methods in clinical practice, from the peeling
   injuries of small distal fingertips to multisegmented amputated limbs,
   and the developmental and tissue engineering approaches for regenerating
   human digits and limbs in the laboratory. Although surgical techniques
   have forged ahead, there are still situations in which digits and limbs
   are unreplantable. Advances in the field are delineated, and the
   regeneration processes of salamander limbs, lizard tails, and mouse
   digits and each component of tissue engineering approaches for digit-and
   limb-building are discussed. Although the current technology is
   promising, there are many challenges in human digit and limb
   regeneration. We hope this review inspires research on the critical gap
   between clinical and basic science, and leads to more sophisticated
   digit and limb loss rescue and regeneration innovations.}},

Abstract = {{With the narrowing of Internet access divide, researchers have focused
   on Internet usage, taking for granted access issues. However, questions
   remain regarding who has Internet access in the United States: What is
   the status of the racial divide? Is there still a gender divide? How do
   Latinos compare to other racial and ethnic minority groups? How does
   gender intersect with race and ethnicity? I analyze nationally
   representative data to compare Internet access among adults from 2007 to
   2012. I find that women are more likely to report having Internet access
   than men. Blacks and Latinos are equally likely to report having
   Internet access, and both groups are less likely to report having
   Internet access than Whites. Finally, Black men exhibited the greatest
   increase in access. This research complements Internet usage studies
   with a recent assessment of Internet access trends, important trends to
   monitor as policies and technological innovations aim for universal
   access.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet plays an increasingly central role in the lives of
   individuals. It enables individuals to engage in social, economic,
   leisure and entertainment activities including wider access to
   information. Due to extensive societal use of the Internet, those
   without access are clearly disadvantaged. They will lack the necessary
   information to make decisions, forgo the savings from shopping online
   and limit their opportunities for social interaction. This paper
   investigates the role that libraries can play in providing free public
   Internet access. This role is examined within the context of Glasgow, a
   large post-industrial city in the United Kingdom where Internet adoption
   is lower than in comparable cities and where a large proportion of its
   population face a range of socio-economic hardships. Primary data was
   collected from library users in three areas of deprivation. Our analysis
   demonstrates the role that libraries play as the provider of public
   Internet access. It shows that this role is not without its difficulties
   - inadequate levels of resources have been provided to fulfill the
   multiple roles that libraries perform in these communities. Libraries
   enable users to engage in a wide array of online activities, the range
   of which reflects both the push of government policies and the pull of
   innovative services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Anticipated environmental sustainability of personal fabrication}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Distributed manufacturing is rapidly proliferating to citizen level via
   the use of digital fabrication equipment, especially in dedicated
   ``makerspaces{''}. The sustainability benefits of citizens' personal
   fabrication are commonly endorsed. However, to assess how these maker
   practitioners actually deal with environmental issues, these
   practitioners and their practices need to be studied. Moreover research
   on the environmental issues in personal fabrication is nascent despite
   the common perception that the digital technologies can become
   disruptive. The present paper is the first to report on how
   practitioners assess the environmental sustainability of future
   practices in this rapidly changing field. It does so through an
   envisioning workshop with leading-edge makers. The findings show that
   these makers are well able to envision the future of their field.
   Roughly 25\% of the issues covered had clear environmental implications.
   Within these, issues of energy use, recycling, reusing and reducing
   materials were covered widely by environmentally-oriented participants.
   In contrast, issues related to emerging technologies, materials and
   practices were covered by other participants, but their environmental
   implications remained unaddressed. The authors concluded there is a gap
   between different maker subcultures in their sustainability orientations
   and competences. Further research on the environmental aspects of
   reallife maker practices and personal fabrication technologies now could
   help avert negative impacts later, as the maker phenomenon spreads. This
   knowledge should also be directed to developing targeted environmental
   guidelines and solutions for personal fabrication users, which are
   currently lacking. Potential also lies in seeking to enhance dialogue
   between pro-environmental and new-technology-oriented practitioners
   through shared spaces, workshops and conferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Histopathological grading of breast ductal carcinoma In Situ: validation
   of a web-based survey through intra-observer reproducibility analysis}},

Abstract = {{Background: Histopathological grading diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in
   situ (DCIS) of the breast may be very difficult even for experts, and it
   is important for therapeutic decisions. The challenge may be due to the
   inaccurate and/or subjective application of the diagnosis criteria. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the intra-observer agreement
   between a traditional method and a developed web-based questionnaire for
   scoring breast DCIS.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the
   diagnostic agreement of an electronic questionnaire and its point
   scoring system with the subjective reading of digital images for 3
   different DCIS grading systems: Holland, Van Nuys and modified Black
   nuclear grade system. Three pathologists analyzed the same set of
   digitized images from 43 DCIS cases using two different web-based
   programs. In the first phase, they accessed a website with a newly
   created questionnaire and scoring system developed to allow the
   determination of the histological grade of the cases. After at least 6
   months, the pathologists read again the same images, but without the
   help of the questionnaire, indicating subjectively the diagnoses. The
   intra-observer agreement analysis was employed to validate this
   innovative web-based survey.
   Results: Overall, diagnostic reproducibility was similar for all
   histologic grading classification systems, with kappa values of 0.57 +/-
   0.10, 0.67 +/- 0.09 and 0.67 +/- 0.09 for Holland, Van Nuys
   classification and modified Black nuclear grade system respectively.
   Only two 2-step diagnostic disagreements were found, one for Holland and
   another for Van Nuys. Both cases were superestimated by the web-based
   survey.
   Conclusion: The diagnostic agreement between the web-based questionnaire
   and a traditional method, both using digital images, is moderate to good
   for Holland, Van Nuys and modified Black nuclear grade system. The use
   of a scoring point system does not appear to pose a major risk of
   presenting large (2-step) diagnostic disagreements. These findings
   indicate that the use of this point scoring system in this web-based
   survey to grade objectively DCIS lesions is a useful diagnostic tool.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the development of a novel bidirectional dynamic
   triaxial instrument. According to the seismic analysis of soil mechanics
   for major geotechnical engineering projects, there is an absence of
   instrumentation to simulate level and horizontal earthquake loads and
   hence a new design is reported here. The bidirectional dynamic triaxial
   instrument was built using a hydraulic servo system, which had excellent
   dynamic response and generated bidirectional excitation force/stress
   with designed amplitude ratios, phases, and waveforms. Advanced digital
   image measurement was used to characterize the dynamic deformation of
   soil in three dimensions. The application of the digital image
   processing is described in detail. The axial average length, radial
   average diameter, average cross-sectional area, and volume of soil were
   easily determined. This non contact measurement is an innovation showing
   that bidirectional excitation with varying amplitude and phase were
   satisfactory. The deformation of the soil was readily obtained. The
   bidirectional dynamic triaxial instrument provides advanced measurements
   of the characteristics of soil under strong earthquake or complex stress
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the global economy has seen the emergence of a digital
   market space. The collaborative and expressive nature of interactive
   media and technology allows users to participate in the production and
   publication of branded content within digital communities of affinity.
   This presents increased possibilities for self-expression, as well as
   unlimited opportunities for participation in determining and influencing
   brand narratives. The digital brandscape has therefore become a
   collaborative space where surplus brand value is produced, but also
   where struggles in terms of power and counter power between brands and
   brand consumers evolve. Against this background, this conceptual article
   explores the brand challenges the notion of consumer brand
   self-expression poses in a collaborative open-source context where brand
   identity is constantly challenged, and brand narratives are continuously
   written and rewritten by multiple brand authors. The article concludes
   that it is important that brands do not navigate these risks by adopting
   defensive stances, but rather boldly seize the opportunities that these
   technologies offer for creating new market linkages and for developing
   customer insights that create innovative brand value and impact, by
   tapping into opportunities for creative self-expression.}},

Abstract = {{Igniting a passion for reading and research is core business for school
   libraries. Today, the learning ecology of schools is as complex and
   changeable as the multiple channels and formats that now shape the
   reading environment for students. Reading is shaped by a diversity of
   texts, interfaces, devices and experiences. In response to ALIA's 2013
   statement (Australian Library and Information Association {[}ALIA],
   2013a) that book collections would establish 50:50 physical to digital
   equilibrium by 2020, the authors sought to understand the current
   context and state of play in school libraries. A survey on ebooks,
   titled 50:50 by 2020 Ebook Trends in Australian Schools, resulted in 450
   responses from schools from all states and territories across
   government, Catholic and independent sectors. Collections are changing
   in response to the need to contextualise ereading within the learning
   and teaching experiences in schools. While the benefits and pedagogical
   rationale of ebooks are recognised, their adoption and use thus far seem
   to be less about pedagogical innovation than about the practicalities of
   collections and services offered by school libraries. Analysis of the
   survey data and other research supports the conclusion that Australian
   school libraries will not reach a projected balance of 50:50 in the
   school library collection by 2020.}},

Abstract = {{On March 17, 2010, the United States Federal Communications Commission
   identified broadband as the great infrastructure challenge of the early
   twenty-first century. One month earlier, on February 10, 2010, in
   anticipation of the FCC's announcement, Google announced its intent to
   build ultra-high-speed broadband networks across the United States to
   serve as a model for overcoming this challenge. Since then, Google
   Fiber, as it is called, has succeeded in being recognized as a model for
   other communities interested in establishing ultra-high-speed broadband
   infrastructure. This article serves as an analysis of the political
   economic consequences of this particular configuration of broadband
   infrastructure, and argues that Google Fiber operates as a mechanism of
   flexible capital whereby the emphases on short- over long-term
   relationships, meritocracy over craftsmanship, and the devaluation of
   past experience in favor of potential outcomes are embedded in the
   institutional and technical infrastructure of ultra-high-speed Internet.}},

Abstract = {{The economic, social and institutional issues of a digital-based society
   impose big challenges to the conventional economic analysis. Because
   value comes from flexibility and immateriality, an economy organized
   around the software establishes a dynamic of short cycles of innovation,
   transient markets and strong propensity to monopolies. The expansion of
   the digital environments helps this pattern to spread through the
   economy as a whole, de-materializing and affecting even the most
   traditional activities. This article discusses what are the main forces
   behind the software economics and outlines a framework to analyze some
   of its variations as they appear in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{It is well acknowledged that innovation is a key success factor in the
   mobile service domain. Having creative ideas is the first critical step
   in the innovation process. Many studies suggest that customers are a
   valuable source of creative ideas. However, the literature also shows
   that adults may be constrained by existing technology frames, which are
   known to hinder creativity. Instead young children (aged 7-12) are
   considered digital natives yet are free from existing technology frames.
   This led us to study them as a potential source for creative mobile
   service ideas. A set of 41,000 mobile ideas obtained from a research
   project in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to study the mobile
   service ideas from young children. We randomly selected two samples of
   ideas (N = 400 each); one contained the ideas from young children, the
   other from adults (aged 17-50). These ideas were evaluated by several
   evaluators using an existing creativity framework. The results show that
   the mobile service ideas from the young children are significantly more
   original, transformational, implementable, and relevant than those from
   the adults. Therefore, this study shows that young children are better
   sources of novel and quality ideas than adults in the mobile services
   domain. This study bears significant contributions to the creativity and
   innovation research. It also indicates a new and valuable source for the
   companies that seek creative ideas for innovative products and services.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most fundamental concerns of teaching English as a foreign
   language (EFL) is to maximize the opportunities of learner-learner talk.
   Digitalized technological facilities can motivate committed teachers to
   adapt and adopt innovative ways of teaching oral skills. This article
   reports on an action research project implemented during one semester
   with a group of 14 willing Master students at the Department of Foreign
   Languages, Mohamed Cherif Messadia University, Souk-Ahras, Algeria. The
   aim was to investigate the effectiveness of the Digital Dedicated
   Language Laboratory (DDLL) in teaching English through a
   discussion-based approach. A well designed protocol made up of three
   types of discussion: framing, conceptual, and application discussions
   was adopted. The findings revealed that students were able to develop
   their linguistic, socio-cultural and pragmatic competences. They were
   also given the opportunity to exploit the various facilities, and tools
   available at the DDLL.}},

Title = {{Electromechanical Impedance - Based Structural Health Monitoring
   Instrumentation System Applied to Aircraft Structures and Employing a

Abstract = {{The electromechanical impedance method has been seen as a promising tool
   for structural health monitoring regarding different types of structures
   and purposes. Most importantly, this method can be used in real-time
   applications. Frequently, massive, high-cost, single-channel impedance
   analyzers are used to process the time domain data, aiming at obtaining
   the complex, frequency-dependent electromechanical impedance functions
   and therefore infer about the presence, position and extent of an
   existing damage. However, for large structures, it is desirable to
   deploy an array of piezoelectric transducers over the area to be
   monitored and interrogate these transducers successively, in order to
   increase the probability of successful detection of damage at an early
   phase. The literature describes many miniaturized systems that can
   monitor large structures, however, presenting serious restrictions on
   data acquisition capabilities. This paper presents a hardware that is
   not limited to any data acquisition restriction, exhibiting an
   innovative way to measure the electromechanical impedance of multiplexed
   bonded transducers. Each logical block of the proposed architecture is
   presented in detail. The proposed system not only avoids costly fast
   Fourier transform analyzers/algorithms, but also evades high-speed data
   acquisition hardware. A prototype using inexpensive integrated circuits
   and a digital signal processor was built and tested for two different
   types of structures: an aluminum beam and an aircraft aluminum panel.
   Simulated damages were introduced to each structure, and the detection
   performance of the prototype was tested. The actual prototype uses a
   universal serial bus connection to communicate with a personal computer.}},

Abstract = {{> Context . Sustainability is among major societal goals in our days.
   Education is acknowledged as an essential strategy for attaining
   sustainability by activating the creative potential within young people
   to understand sustainability, bring forth changes in their everyday
   life, and collectively envision a more sustainable future.> Problem .
   However, teaching and learning about sustainability and
   sustainability-related issues is not an easy task due to the inherent
   complexity, ambiguity, and context-specificity of the concept. We are in
   need of innovative pedagogical approaches and tools that will allow us
   to design learning activities in which learners will be empowered to
   develop new, alternative interpretations of sustainability in personally
   and collectively meaningful ways.> Method . We argue that a
   constructionist perspective involving the use of expressive media for
   digital storytelling offers an appropriate frame or designing learning
   activities fostering collaborative creativity in thinking and learning
   about urban sustainability. Our study is based on the design of a
   learning activity following this rationale. We adopted a qualitative
   approach in the collection and analysis of different sources of data
   with the aim to explore collaborative creativity as a learning process
   based on the students collective processes and resulting in the
   co-construction of new ideas and insights about sustainability, and new
   tangible artefacts (the digital stories) encompassingthem.> Results .
   Our analysis of the collaborative creativity exemplified in the three
   digital stories produced identified important creative elements with
   regards to the three components of a digital story (script, technical
   characteristics, and ideas of urban sustainability) and how they were
   embodied in each digital story produced as a result of the students'
   joint constructionist activity. > Implications . Our study provides some
   preliminary evidence that collaborative creativity from a
   constructionist perspective can stand as an appropriate framework for
   designing learning activities addressing the difficult concept of
   sustainability. There are several implications for both theory and
   educational practice in environmental education and education for
   sustainable development, constructionism, and digital storytelling in
   education. Moreover, our study opens up new fields for research and
   theory in creativity.}},

Abstract = {{As access to high speed internet connections and digital tools increase,
   many museums are incorporating online and/or blended (a combination of
   onsite and online) programming in their portfolio to deepen work with
   existing audiences and/or reach new ones. To leverage the potential of
   ongoing innovation in the tech sector, museum educators will need to
   embrace change, take calculated risks as promising new tools and
   approaches emerge, and adopt a learning stance to propel their work
   forward through an ongoing process of application, reflection, and
   refinement. While many museum educators already facilitate programming
   in a range of physical and virtual learning environments, others may
   need to learn new skills to effectively facilitate programs in diverse
   program platforms and engage users from around the world. Beyond
   shifting demographics, the increasing range and quantity of
   informational texts and multi-media content available on museum websites
   is challenging the field to rethink what can and should happen in person
   and what might best be accomplished online. As users fluidly move
   between online and in-person engagement, museums will need to develop
   strategies and/or structures to ensure these experiences are considered
   as a cohesive whole.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, two new audiovisual products have arrived to
   the Web: documentary web (webdoc) and interactive music video. The
   emergence of these new subgenres is due to three related conversion
   factors: the evolution of online audience participation, the arrival of
   new web standards and codes html5, and the interest of the media and
   authors in the innovation of online narratives. From the study of the
   technical qualities of two case studies -the interactive documentary One
   Million Tower and the interactive music video The Wilderness
   Downtown-this article asserts a new typology for the study and analysis
   of these interactive audiovisual productions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to observe how the disruptive innovation
   generated by technologies, processes and information management systems
   (creation, recovery, traffic, and access), which is implemented through
   social metamedia on the Web, are adopted by traditional media to
   rebalance their business models and value-added networks. In the last
   ten years, print media in Europe have lost more than 50 million copies
   in daily circulation, and television is suffering from audience
   fragmentation and loss of advertising sales. Many newspapers around the
   world have stopped printing and other large media companies have changed
   hands or undergone major restructuring. The global media industry's
   annual growth is expected to be 5.5\% until 2018 but digital advertising
   is estimated at 10.7\% per year.}},

Abstract = {{Among the information systems that have emerged in recent years there is
   iVoz, created in 2012, that comes from the combination of organizational
   creativity and technological innovation. The creativity of an
   organization -the Voz de Galicia Corporation- allowed the design of a
   procedure to deal with information, and consequently to manage its
   objectives, processes, and results. Technological innovation has made
   possible an information management procedure focused on very specific
   aims. The new procedure has allowed the introduction of important
   changes in the aims of the company, in the production of new information
   contents, and its dissemination. Details on how this management system
   works, how it fits into the Corporation, and the main results are
   explained. Finally, the communication possibilities that are now open,
   especially for local information, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in applying novel eHealth approaches for the
   prevention and management of various health conditions, with the
   ultimate goal of increasing positive patient outcomes and improving the
   effectiveness and efficiency of health services delivery. Coupled with
   the use of innovative approaches is the possibility for adverse
   outcomes, highlighting the need to strategically refine digital
   practices prior to implementation with patients. One appropriate method
   for modification purposes includes focus groups. Although it is a
   well-established method in qualitative research, there is a lack of
   guidance regarding the use of focus groups for digital intervention
   refinement. To address this gap, the purpose of our paper is to
   highlight several lessons our research team has learned in using focus
   groups to help refine digital interventions prior to use with patients.}},

Abstract = {{Temoa is a distributor of knowledge that provides a multilingual public
   catalog of collections of Open Educational Resources (OER). Temoa seeks
   to support the educational community to find the resources and materials
   that meet their needs for teaching and learning, through a specialized

   after the need to expand educational coverage in the world, and
   specifically in developing countries. This paper aims to analyze the
   system of classification and metadata schemes of Temoa. Interviews were
   carried out to obtain information. Results shows Temoa's cataloging
   process: reviewing OER design, form, and content; the actors
   participating in the process. We conclude that Temoa is a useful tool
   that helps to integrate OER into teaching practices, encouraging
   Knowledge Transfer and Dissemination of innovative educational

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate experiences with leveraging health information
   technology (HIT) to improve patient care and population health, and
   reduce healthcare expenditures.
   Materials and methods In-depth qualitative interviews with federal
   government employees, health policy, HIT and medico-legal experts,
   health providers, physicians, purchasers, payers, patient advocates, and
   vendors from across the United States.
   Results The authors undertook 47 interviews. There was a widely shared
   belief that Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
   Health (HITECH) had catalyzed the creation of a digital infrastructure,
   which was being used in innovative ways to improve quality of care and
   curtail costs. There were however major concerns about the poor
   usability of electronic health records (EHRs), their limited ability to
   support multi-disciplinary care, and major difficulties with health
   information exchange, which undermined efforts to deliver integrated
   patient-centered care. Proposed strategies for enhancing the benefits of
   HIT included federal stimulation of competition by mandating vendors to
   open-up their application program interfaces, incenting development of
   low-cost consumer informatics tools, and promoting Congressional review
   of the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
   to optimize the balance between data privacy and reuse. Many underscored
   the need to ``kick the legs from underneath the fee-for-service
   model{''} and replace it with a data-driven reimbursement system that
   rewards high quality care.
   Conclusions The HITECH Act has stimulated unprecedented,
   multi-stakeholder interest in HIT. Early experiences indicate that the
   resulting digital infrastructure is being used to improve quality of
   care and curtail costs. Reform efforts are however severely limited by
   problems with usability, limited interoperability and the persistence of
   the fee-for-service paradigm-addressing these issues therefore needs to
   be the federal government's main policy target.}},

Abstract = {{Tree-ring analysis is a basic technique of paramount importance in
   forest management, yet it may prove difficult and time-consuming for
   many slow-growth hardwood tree species. Moreover, it requires the use of
   specialized tools and proprietary software, which may hinder researchers
   working with limited budgets. We describe an innovative and inexpensive
   method using DIVA-GIS freeware software to analyze true color
   high-resolution scanned images of cores previously enhanced with ImageJ
   freeware (GIS-SDI), and test its accuracy against the widely-used
   LINTAB-TSAPWin (TM) and WinDENDRO (TM) methods. For this purpose, Abies
   pinsapo and Pyrus bourgaeana increment cores were processed
   independently using each of the three methods and the results were
   statistically compared. Dating results were consistent across all three
   methods, although identifying rings was easier and quicker to perform on
   the digital images. Using a modern but affordable flatbed scanner to
   digitize tree cores and the free DIVA-GIS software to analyze the
   scanned digital images proved to be an inexpensive but highly accurate
   and efficient approach to tree-ring analysis. Furthermore, this method
   greatly facilitates tree-ring analysis in species with inconspicuous
   rings, and enables a complete digital record of every core analyzed to
   be stored.}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Government landscape is continuously changing to reflect how
   governments are trying to find innovative digital solutions to social,
   economic, political and other pressures, and how they transform
   themselves in the process. Understanding and predicting such changes is
   important for policymakers, government executives, researchers and all
   those who prepare, make, implement or evaluate Digital Government
   decisions. This article argues that the concept of Digital Government
   evolves toward more complexity and greater contextualization and
   specialization, similar to evolution-like processes that lead to changes
   in cultures and societies. To this end, the article presents a
   four-stage Digital Government Evolution Model comprising Digitization
   (Technology in Government), Transformation (Electronic Government),
   Engagement (Electronic Governance) and Contextualization (Policy-Driven
   Electronic Governance) stages; provides some evidence in support of this
   model drawing upon the study of the Digital Government literature
   published in Government Information Quarterly between 1992 and 2014; and
   presents a Digital Government Stage Analysis Framework to explain the
   evolution. As the article consolidates a representative body of the
   Digital Government literature, it could be also used for defining and
   integrating future research in the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{While the literature analyzing the cross-national determinants of
   e-government performance reports robust results for structural
   variables, the level of agreement regarding political factors remains
   low. Deriving theories from comparative political science, this article
   hypothesizes how regime type and government capacity determine the
   global variation in e-government. Methodologically, the paper adds
   several points to improve accuracy in statistical analyses using the
   United Nations E-Government Development Index, which have often been
   afflicted by improper model specifications. Empirically, all seven
   editions of the index are tested under a common framework in
   cross-sectional regression analyses, revealing several interdependent
   trends. While the innovation-friendly environment of democracies was the
   primary political source of e-government development, autocracies are
   catching up in order to enhance pro-regime activism on the internet and
   legitimize their rule by improving economic performance. Government
   capacity also grows in importance, as e-government programs have become
   more technologically sophisticated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The glass industry requires the use of innovative ceramics that enable
   for long lifetimes. At very high temperatures, one of the key parameters
   for ceramics is their creep resistance. The characterization of the
   creep behavior, usually assessed through flexural tests, can be complex
   when an asymmetry appears between tension and compression. To detect and
   quantify such asymmetrical behaviors, the use of Digital Image
   Correlation (DIC) is proposed. First, several challenges are to be
   tackled for DIC at high temperature, namely, the random pattern
   stability, the radiation filtering and the heat haze. They are
   exacerbated by the limited possibilities to heat ceramics, the
   nonuniform strain fields and their low levels. Beyond several
   experimental developments, the strain uncertainties are decreased thanks
   to the use of two global approaches of DIC based on ad hoc
   finite-element kinematics. Last, the proposed methodology is applied to
   the analysis of asymmetric creep at 1350 degrees C of an industrial
   zircon ceramic designed for its high creep resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Today the influence of non-volatile solid-state memories on persons'
   lives has become more prominent because of their non-volatility, low
   data latency, and high robustness. As a pioneering technology that is
   representative of non-volatile solid-state memories, flash memory has
   recently seen widespread application in many areas ranging from
   electronic appliances, such as cell phones and digital cameras, to
   external storage devices such as universal serial bus (USB) memory.
   Moreover, owing to its large storage capacity, it is expected that in
   the near future, flash memory will replace hard-disk drives as a
   dominant technology in the mass storage market, especially because of
   recently emerging solid-state drives. However, the rapid growth of the
   global digital data has led to the need for flash memories to have
   larger storage capacity, thus requiring a further downscaling of the
   cell size. Such a miniaturization is expected to be extremely difficult
   because of the well-known scaling limit of flash memories. It is
   therefore necessary to either explore innovative technologies that can:
   extend the areal density of flash memories beyond the scaling limits, or
   to vigorously develop alternative non-volatile solid-state memories
   including ferroelectric random-access memory, magnetoresistive
   random-access memory, phase-change random-access memory, and resistive
   random-access memory. In this paper, we review the physical principles
   of flash memories and their technical challenges that affect our ability
   to enhance the storage capacity. We then present a detailed discussion
   of novel technologies that can extend the storage density of flash
   memories beyond the commonly accepted limits. In each case, we
   subsequently discuss the physical principles of these new types of
   non-volatile solid-state memories as well as their respective merits and
   weakness when utilized for data storage applications. Finally, we
   predict the future prospects for the aforementioned solid-state memories
   for the next generation of data-storage devices based on a comparison of
   their performance.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``creative economy{''} has attracted worldwide attention.
   Creative economy may be defined as a policy that aims to generate new
   growth through economic operations that promote creativity, knowledge
   convergence, and advanced scientific technology based on coordinate
   learning, consequently creating new markets and new jobs. This can be
   understood to be a new development that has evolved beyond the
   chase-and-imitate economic model that has been followed by most
   developing countries up until now. This special issue investigates the
   impact of a creative economy in diverse academic realms, including
   economics, business, sociology, tourism and others. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multicarrier 60 GHz transmitter for distance
   measurement (ranging) in an indoor wireless localization system,
   achieving mm-precision with high update rate. The architecture comprises
   a baseband subcarrier generator, an upconverter, and a power amplifier.
   There are three key innovations, all stemming from careful
   hardware-algorithm co-design: 1) efficient frequency planning of the 6
   GHz-wide band; 2) power-efficient multicarrier signal generation by
   means of digital frequency divisions exploiting the phase-based
   time-of-arrival ranging algorithm; and 3) PAPR reduction to enable
   efficient operation of the power amplifier. By implementing these key
   techniques, 0.7-2.7 mm precision is achieved over 5 m measured distance
   with 5.4 mu s symbol duration. During operation, the core digital
   subcarrier generator generates 16 non-equidistant subcarriers from a 3
   GHz input clock, while consuming an average power of 1.8 mW out of 0.9V
   supply. The upconverter and the power amplifier altogether consume
   around 127 mW. The total area of the transmitter is 1.1 mm(2). The chip
   is fabricated in a 40nm general purpose CMOS process.}},

Abstract = {{Direct period synthesis is a technique of using a base time unit and the
   time-average-frequency concept to synthesize clock frequency. Its
   distinguished capabilities include generating frequencies in very fine
   step and switching frequency in very fast speed. In this paper, the
   principle of fine frequency generation is presented. Using data
   collected from two 55-nm CMOS chips, experimental evidence of sub-ppm
   (0.04 ppm at finest) frequency resolution at 27 MHz, 1.5 GHz, and 2.4
   GHz is provided. This feature of fine frequency resolution is very
   important in digital communication, especially for plesiochronous and
   heterochronous systems. It is a circuit level enabler for system level
   innovation. In the last part of this paper, several important
   applications of using these capabilities are explored.}},

Abstract = {{The past two decades have seen a proliferation of large- and small-scale
   experiments in participatory governance. This article takes stock of
   claims about the potential of citizen participation to advance three
   values of democratic governance: effectiveness, legitimacy, and social
   justice. Increasing constraints on the public sector in many societies,
   combined with increasing demand for individual engagement and the
   affordances of digital technology, have paved the way for participatory
   innovations aimed at effective governance. Deepening legitimation
   deficits of representative government create opportunities for
   legitimacy-enhancing forms of citizen participation, but so far, the
   effect of participation on legitimacy is unclear. Efforts to increase
   social justice through citizen participation face the greatest
   obstacles. The article concludes by highlighting three challenges to
   creating successful participatory governance: the absence of systematic
   leadership, the lack of popular or elite consensus on the place of
   direct citizen participation, and the limited scope and powers of
   participatory innovations.}},

Abstract = {{We present first results from the third GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy
   Testing (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for
   testing methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear
   distortions from simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into
   experiments to test three specific questions, and included simulated
   space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying
   shear fields. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric
   galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and
   ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other
   experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology,
   multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying
   PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24
   participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within
   systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys,
   making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and
   innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or
   exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the
   statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy
   morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by similar to
   1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation
   biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy
   type as measured by the S,rsic index, are quantified for the first time.
   Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to
   galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing
   and defocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in
   which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and up-to-date information on the time-varying topography of
   active volcanoes is crucial for assessing material flows through these
   volcanic systems and along their surfaces. As dome-building volcanoes
   can change on meter scale within short time intervals in active phases,
   conventionally used repeat-pass SAR-interferometry (InSAR) often fails
   due to decorrelation effects, while other methods to measure topography
   like aerial photogrammetry or Lidar depend on the availability of the
   local infrastructure and on good weather conditions. Here, we show the
   potential of the spaceborne Earth observation mission TanDEM-X to
   monitor topographic changes at active dome-building volcanoes. In this
   innovative satellite mission, two nearly identical satellites fly in a
   close formation, taking radar images of the Earth's surface at the same
   time in bistatic mode. This opens the possibility to generate digital
   elevation models (DEMs) of volcanoes. Analyzing a series of repeated
   DEMs enables assessment of volume changes caused by lava dome activity.
   We apply this method to Merapi in Indonesia by analyzing the volume
   changes during the hazardous 2010 eruption. During this eruption, the
   old lava dome collapsed, and a new lava dome was extruded which
   collapsed again within twelve days. We show three DEMs derived from
   bistatic TanDEM-X InSAR in descending orbit taken before and after the
   eruption. We found a mean volume change of 19 x 10(6) m(3) in the summit
   area. The two estimates differ by 0.4 x 106 m3 which is 2\% of the
   average dome volume change. The TanDEM-X based results are about 25\%
   lower than reference data, which can be explained by the shadow masks
   that were introduced to exclude geometrically decorrelated areas,
   resulting in conservative volume change estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc

Abstract = {{Today, to survive in an extremely turbulent business environment,
   traditional products characterized by limited capabilities cannot
   satisfy diverse customer requirements. In particular, it is observed
   that the boundaries between smart phones, digital cameras, and tablets
   are becoming more and more blurred than before. Therefore, for
   attracting the ad-hoc segments, global companies began to develop hybrid
   pad-phones and phone-cameras. Unfortunately, some of these products are
   facing poor sales without incurring much market attention. In order to
   overcome the aforementioned difficulty, this paper presents a novel
   framework to reduce the gaps between producer expectation and user
   perception. By means of the TRIZ (the theory of inventive problem
   solving), a contradiction matrix is applied to handle engineering
   conflicts among multi-functional alternatives to seek inventive
   solutions. Then, ARM (association rule mining) is conducted to identify
   critical features that formulate customer dissatisfaction (purchase
   intention). Finally, CA (conjoint analysis) is employed to derive
   customer utilities for benchmarking varieties of design concepts. In
   summary, the proposed framework cannot only help product planners
   efficiently generate innovative ideas, but also effectively justify the
   validity of design concepts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine trade policy determinants and trade reform in
   a developing country setting using a political economy model. The
   government determines tariffs by balancing the political support from
   producers vs. consumers, while placing a higher political weight on
   producers' welfare relative to average citizens. We then expand the
   model in several directions to guide our subsequent estimations at the
   three-digit industry level for Colombia between 1983 and 1998. We
   account for import substitution motives for protection but describe how
   the government's move away from these policies leads to unilateral trade
   liberalization. We innovatively allow the political weights to vary
   based on key industry variables beyond a common denominator. The sectors
   with higher employment, labor cost, and preferential trade agreement
   (PTA) import shares receive a larger political weight compared to
   otherwise similar sectors. The novelty of our approach is estimating the
   effect of sectoral characteristics on protection filtered through the
   political weights. We obtain more realistic estimates for these weights
   and provide some evidence for a slowing down effect of PTAs on trade
   liberalization.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The energy savings potential within non-domestic buildings from
   behaviour change initiatives is well known. Energy efficiency measures
   can contribute to local, national and EU policy commitments on carbon
   reduction. Yet, research also shows behaviour change is anything but
   simple. No-where is this more evident that in local government where
   municipalities are expected to lead on carbon reduction initiatives
   whilst operating in challenging political landscapes. This paper
   reflects on a UK Research Council funded case study exploring the role
   of engagement in a UK municipality. Innovative feedback tools and
   user-engagement were developed in an effort to foster a collaborative
   approach to energy management. Findings from an analysis of a focus
   group and a set of semi-structured interviews show encouraging signs
   with regard to increased user-engagement and digital tools, but barriers
   remain with regards to the `real world' implementation of innovative,
   and technologically grounded, approaches. These included a staff
   reduction programme amidst financial cuts, a risk-averse culture with
   regard to new technologies, and debate about where responsibilities lie
   with regards to energy management. While these findings were case
   specific they have implications for organisations contemplating how
   technology might support them in workplace engagement for reduced energy
   use. Crown (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It is an undisputed fact that scientific discovery has been notably
   present in cinema since its early origins, either as a precursor of the
   Cinematographe's invention in the twilight of the nineteenth century or
   even as a tool intended for the technical improvement of the audiovisual
   aids and the progressive quality of image and sound, as well as a
   driving force in the opening-up to modern digitalization nowadays. Our
   aim in this article is to have a short tour around the most prominent
   scientists that have led the history of film in a wide sense, from the
   early inventors and the pioneers of special effects and trick
   photography to the on-screen sociologically stereotypes that audiovisual
   means have provided for decades. Finally, we also discuss the
   advertising or warning role that motion pictures have carried out to
   mainly reflect the prosperities and adversities that techno-scientific
   progress may entail.}},

Abstract = {{About 15\%-25\% of the aging population suffers from swallowing
   difficulties, and this creates an increasing market need for mass
   customization of food. The food industry is investigating mass
   customization techniques to meet the individual needs of taste,
   nutrition, and mouthfeel. Three dimensional (3D) food printing is a
   potential solution to overcome drawbacks of current food customization
   techniques, such as lower production efficiency and high manufacturing
   cost. This study introduces the first-generation food printer concept
   designs and functional prototypes targeted to revolutionize customized
   food fabrication by 3D printing (3DP). Unlike the robotics-based food
   manufacturing technologies designed to automate manual processes for
   mass production, 3D food printing integrates 3DP and digital gastronomy
   technique to customize food products. This introduces artistic
   capabilities into domestic cooking and extends customization
   capabilities to the industrial culinary sector. Its application in
   domestic cooking or catering services can not only provide an
   engineering solution for customized food design and personalized
   nutrition control, but also has the potential to reconfigure customized
   food supply chains.
   In this paper, the selected prototypes are reviewed based on fabrication
   platforms and printing materials. A detailed discussion on specific 3DP
   technologies and the associated dispensing/printing process for 3D
   customized food fabrication with single and multi-material applications
   is reported. Lastly, impacts of food printing on customized food
   fabrication, personalized nutrition, food supply chain, and food
   processing technologies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides an analysis of the most relevant aspects relating
   to the pedagogic integration of the Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT), especially the Smart Board Interactive whiteboard
   (SBIW) in the teaching and learning of English. The objective was to
   describe and evaluate how the application of ICT as a technological tool
   affects English language acquisition among sixth grade students of a
   public primary school in Asturias, Spain. Following a qualitative
   ethnographic methodology, this study revealed descriptive information
   about the participants and the impact of the technology on the education
   process. The data collection was achieved via different qualitative
   techniques: direct observation, journals of the class and semi
   structured interviews with the teacher and the sixth grade students. An
   analysis of the results revealed elements, aspects and situations in
   which the use of these technological tools benefits the teaching
   methodology and the acquisition of a second language by the students.
   The conclusions indicate that the SBIW and the ICT in the classroom
   generate educational innovations applicable to language teaching
   methodologies, as well as directly influencing and enhancing the
   acquisition of language skills in the students.}},

   dimensions that the state of knowledge poses to examine entrepreneurship
   on the Internet. We surveyed a nonrandom sample of 143 students from a
   public university in order to test the hypothesis that there are
   differences between users of Information Technology and Communication
   due to its degree and with respect to their levels of less significance
   than 0.001 for empathy factors, risk, opportunity, entrepreneurship,
   usefulness, ease, commitment, knowledge, innovation, use and
   satisfaction. The results show that only in the case of empathy {[}x2 =

Abstract = {{The geometric features of agricultural trees such as canopy area, tree
   height and crown volume provide useful information about plantation
   status and crop production. However, these variables are mostly
   estimated after a time-consuming and hard field work and applying
   equations that treat the trees as geometric solids, which produce
   inconsistent results. As an alternative, this work presents an
   innovative procedure for computing the 3-dimensional geometric features
   of individual trees and tree-rows by applying two consecutive phases: 1)
   generation of Digital Surface Models with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
   technology and 2) use of object-based image analysis techniques. Our
   UAV-based procedure produced successful results both in single-tree and
   in tree-row plantations, reporting up to 97\% accuracy on area
   quantification and minimal deviations compared to in-field estimations
   of tree heights and crown volumes. The maps generated could be used to
   understand the linkages between tree grown and field-related factors or
   to optimize crop management operations in the context of precision
   agriculture with relevant agro-environmental implications.}},

Title = {{Is there a role for Digital X-ray Radiogrammetry as surrogate marker for
   radiological progression and imaging of structural integrity in
   rheumatoid arthritis?}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The established scoring techniques based on radiographs
   present limitations in the evaluation of structural integrity due to
   high effectiveness of innovative therapeutic strategies. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the periarticular mineralisation as detected by
   Digital X-ray Radiogrammetry (DXR) as surrogate marker for structural
   integrity during the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods: 11 centers throughout Germany contributed data of 94 patients
   with verified RA. The patients were treated with leflunomide or
   methotrexate during a mean observation period of 22 months. All patients
   underwent complete computerized calculations of bone mineral density
   (BMD) and metacarpal index (MCI) by DXR using digitized hand
   radiographs. The radiological assessment of disease progression was
   estimated by the Sharp Score.
   Results: The Sharp Score revealed no significant change during the study
   period. DXR-BMD revealed minimal decrease of -1.4 \% (leflunomide group)
   versus a higher reduction of -4.3 \% (methotrexate group). Regarding
   DXR-MCI, a reduction of -2.2 \% (leflunomide group) and -4.9 \%
   (methotrexate group) was observed.
   Conclusion: Quantitative data of hand bone mass estimated by the
   presented DXR-technique may be a complementary precise tool in the
   identification of RA-related radiographic changes and in the assessment
   of structural integrity.}},

Title = {{Youth peers put the ``invent{''} into NutriBee's online intervention}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early adolescents perceive peers as credible and relatable.
   Peers therefore have a unique conduit to engage early adolescents in
   positive health behaviors through nutrition learning such as that
   recommended by the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM).
   Purpose: We developed an online, peer leader component to an existing
   in-person preventive nutrition intervention called NutriBee. We reasoned
   that youth ages 13-18 could create intervention materials that could
   remain engaging, credible and relatable to younger peers ages 10-12
   online. Peer leaders could potentially derive health benefits from their
   service-learning experience.
   Methods: From 2013-2014 youth could apply online to relate a personal
   interest to nutrition, an opportunity promoted at NutriBee pilot sites
   and through social media. The peer leaders with diverse backgrounds
   honed original ideas into tangible projects with the support of adult
   subject-matter experts chosen by the youth. Nutrition expertise was
   provided by NutriBee staff who then also converted the youth-invented
   projects from various media into an online curriculum.
   Results: 19 of 27 (70\%) of selected youth from 12 states and diverse
   backgrounds, created an online curriculum comprising 10\% of NutriBee's
   20-hour intervention. All 19 online projects modeled 1 or more of
   NutriBee's 10 positive health behaviors; 8 evoked the chemosenses; 6
   conveyed food texture; and 13 provided social context. Peer leaders
   perceived career advancement and service learning benefits. The dose,
   pedagogic approach, and project content align with the IOM
   recommendation.
   Conclusions: Youth created intervention materials which communicate
   positive health behaviors online in ways peers can adopt. In a
   customarily sight-sound digital platform, youth leveraged the senses of
   smell, taste and touch and social context important for food selection.
   Peer leaders derived health benefit, as indirectly assessed by IOM
   criteria.}},

Abstract = {{New services, like fabrication spaces, 3D printer rentals and virtual
   marketplaces, have made it easier for empowered consumers to co-create
   innovative products without almost any involvement of traditional
   companies. Adopting a consumer-grounded view, this work takes a step
   forward from the existing service literature by investigating the link
   between psychological motives and happiness in co-creation.
   Specifically, the study measures how community affiliation, personal
   growth and utilitarian motives are predictors of subjective well-being
   (SWB). The results illustrate that community affiliation and personal
   growth motives predict high scores of SWB, while utilitarian motives do
   not. In addition, empowered consumers who co-create with others are
   happier than consumers who create alone. This indicates that direct
   interactions are not only a powerful platform for service co-creation,
   but are also predictors of SWB. We discuss the implications for
   traditional companies and for decision makers regarding the benefits
   offered by digital fabrication services.}},

Abstract = {{The UK government is mandating the use of building information modelling
   (BIM) in large public projects by 2016. As a result, engineering firms
   are faced with challenges related to embedding new technologies and
   associated working practices for the digital delivery of major
   infrastructure projects. Diffusion of innovations theory is used to
   investigate how digital innovations diffuse across complex firms. A
   contextualist approach is employed through an in-depth case study of a
   large, international engineering project-based firm. The analysis of the
   empirical data, which was collected over a four-year period of close
   interaction with the firm, reveals parallel paths of diffusion occurring
   across the firm, where both the innovation and the firm context were
   continually changing. The diffusion process is traced over three phases:
   centralization of technology management, standardization of digital
   working practices, and globalization of digital resources. The findings
   describe the diffusion of a digital innovation as multiple and partial
   within a complex social system during times of change and organizational
   uncertainty, thereby contributing to diffusion of innovations studies in
   construction by showing a range of activities and dynamics of a
   non-linear diffusion process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper asks whether destabilizations associated with the global
   financial crisis and rapid innovation in digital technologies may be
   creating possibilities for a rebalancing of commercial market and other
   values associated with equality and fairness in policy interventions
   aimed at building knowledge societies. An analysis of high-level policy
   speeches and a selection of digital technology projects provides a basis
   for reflections on this question. The paper considers whether recent
   destabilizations are encouraging challenges to the discourses and
   practices associated with market-led technology diffusion models. The
   analysis indicates that there are some shifts in the discourses, but
   there is less evidence of shifts in practice. It is suggested that
   greater attention to the complex features of the innovation process may
   help to foster stakeholder learning in a way that might favour values
   consistent with inclusive and equitable knowledge societies.}},
