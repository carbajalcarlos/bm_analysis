Abstract = {{An innovative, computationally efficient digital signal processing
   algorithm has been proposed to evaluate the fundamental frequency of a
   non-sinusoidal power system signal at every sample instant. This
   approach adopts backward difference approximation as second derivative
   FIR filter to estimate the instantaneous frequency. Besides this, an
   efficient square root algorithm, based on iterative Newton-Raphson
   Inverse (NRI) method is also presented to get high accuracy in fixed
   point processor. The method is illustrated and evaluated in real time by
   means of a Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320VC5416 digital signal processor
   (DSP). The experimental results confirm the validity and accurate
   performance of the proposed approach even under slow magnitude and
   frequency variations.}},

   architectures (SOA) by large information system (IS) vendors might push
   software development towards an industrialized mode of operation. The
   emergence of such a software ecosystem is analyzed through an innovation
   perspective. The special nature of software as an intellectual
   technology, thus being an intangible product as opposed to physical
   products, is given special emphasis. Since digital products are
   expensive to produce, but cheap to reproduce, it is argued on the basis
   of a resource-based view that this ecosystem should not solely be built
   on the trading of software, but also on the exchange of business

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an innovative resolution doubling technology used
   in dynamic mask and applies it to rapid prototyping (RP) system. By the
   advantage of this resolution doubling technology, the feature size of
   mask type RP systems can be increased remarkably. The implementation of
   this technology is based on a laboratory build micro-RP system. This
   study includes optical design, mask generation for a set of scatter
   images, motion control, and resin spray coating. The optical system is
   transferring the reflecting image of continuing pixels from digital
   mirror device (DMD) chip onto scatter pixels and projecting on the resin
   surface. Mask generation software is designed to convert a mask image to
   a set of scatter images. The resin spray coating is used to add new
   layer material on the surface of the resin tank for ongoing parts build.
   As the results, high definition RP parts have been build.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, skill preservation of an expert has been a serious problem of
   the medical or production fields. If digital skill preservation as a
   bilateral database is attained, it may become an innovative solution of
   the problem. This paper proposes a motion acquisition and reproduction
   of human motion by the interaction mode control. The proposed
   interaction mode control can control only the interactions between the
   systems. The interactions are abstracted by using the quarry matrix.
   Since the quarry matrix can divide systems into decoupled modes, it is
   possible to design a controller in the modal space. The order of the
   quarry matrix corresponds to the number of human finger. Thus the
   skilled motion by a human is easily obtained and analyzed in the modal
   space by using the quarry matrix.
   The experimental results show viability of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Demands for personal digital assistants (PDA) call for them to be
   additionally low profile, lightweight, and low power. To fulfill these
   demands, it is necessary to develop a backlight unit that features
   low-power consumption, high brightness, and high efficiency. The light
   source in a backlight unit has a light guide plate, which is a highly
   important component. The light guide plate has dots to reflect light. It
   is known that the smaller the dots and the higher the aspect ratio, the
   brighter the screen. The result of a simulation revealed that it is
   possible to improve the brightness of light guide plate by forming the
   shape of a truncated cone with a taper angle of 68 to 78 degrees.
   However, using the existing machining technology, it is difficult to
   form the dots into such a shape. Producing a desired shape, like a
   tapered shape, in the depthwise direction is difficult even with
   lithography, although using an elaborate mask pattern, this technique
   can produce a sophisticated shape on a two-dimensional plane. We have
   produced a tapered microstructure with a high aspect ratio, devising an
   innovative method of diffracted light exposure based on a lithography
   technique making use of UV light source. Furthermore, we controlled the
   taper angle and fabricated a light guide plate through a mold master,
   Ni-electroforming, and an injection molding by using UV-LIGA process.}},

Abstract = {{As device technology progresses toward 45nm and beyond, the fidelity of
   the process parameter modeling becomes questionable. In this paper we
   propose the concept of process variation (PV) testing. This is achieved
   by applying an innovative fault model and test methodology that uses PV
   sensing circuitry and frequency domain analysis. Rather than pinpointing
   the variation of different parameters, our architecture looks at the
   effect of PV in a chip indirectly and collectively. The novelty of this
   architecture is in shifting the strategy of VLSI testing to frequency
   domain by using a distributed network of frequency-sensitive circuits
   such as ring oscillators. This provides an intrinsic advantage by
   minimizing the effect of noise (signal integrity loss, crosstalk, IR
   drop, etc.) and by using the powerful concept of digital signal
   processing for test analysis. The test architecture does not interfere
   with the rest of the circuit thus providing freedom to tune accuracy of
   the PV test by choosing the proper number and type of oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the project FIRB 2001 the Italian Ministry of
   Education, University and Research (MIUR) has supported the research
   project RBAUOIZM5 aimed to produce a tomography system able to acquire
   3D images of cells in laminar flow. The innovative aspects of the new
   Image Flow Cytometer (IFC) designed and prototyped under this project
   regard to both the hardware and the software architecture. In
   particular, it is able to automatically identifiy micronuclei on the
   acquired images of flowing lymphocytes. Therefore, the new IFC overcomes
   the characteristics of the conventional ones.
   The paper focuses on the software innovations regarding to (i) the
   digital signal processing procedure, (ii) the optimized methodology for
   classifying the different cell types, (iii) the programmable gain of
   each input channel, and (iv) the image preprocessing to detect the
   micronucleus in the acquired image of the human lymphocytes. In order to
   highlight the improved performance of the IFC software architecture,
   results of preliminary experimental tests are shown.}},

   among data subcarriers, and both unidimensional and bidimensional linear

Abstract = {{As described in {[}1], in 2005 the Brazilian government supported many
   research consortia in order to develop a Digital Television System
   employing advanced technologies for multimedia broadcasting. One of the
   proposals for the physical layer of this system was entitled Innovative
   Modulation for the Brazilian Digital TV System (MI-SBTVD). The MI-SBTVD
   Project includes high performance error-correcting codes, transmit
   spatial diversity and multi-carrier modulation. The objective of this
   article is to present the synchronization techniques that were used in
   the first proof-of-concept for the MI-SBTVD System. We present the
   simulated performance results for both the AWGN and multipath channels.
   Finally, we also comment on the implementation details of the
   synchronization scheme using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
   devices.}},

   Ridge. The ASIC is composed of 64 channels with low noise charge
   amplification, filtering, timing and amplitude measurement circuits,
   where an innovative current-mode peak-detector and digitizer (PDAD) is
   adopted. The proposed PDAD provides at the same time peak detection and
   A/D conversion in real time, at low power, and without requiring a clock

Abstract = {{The trend in data acquisition systems for modern physics experiments is
   to digitize analog signals closer and closer to the detector. The
   digitization systems have followed the progress of commercial analog to
   digital converters. The state of the art for these devices is currently
   200 MSample/s for a 14-bit range. The new boards, described in this
   paper, have been designed to improve these performances by more than an
   order of magnitude. This board mainly includes 4 channels sampling
   analog data up to 2 GSamples/s with an analog bandwidth of 300 MHz, and
   digitizing it with a 14-bit dynamic range. It is based on the
   custom-designed MATACQ chip. The latter's innovative design permits
   reaching these performances with power consumption smaller than 1W, thus
   allowing a total consumption below 20W for the whole board. The board is
   triggerable either by internal or external signals and several boards
   are easily synchronizable. The board integrates USB, GPIB and VME
   interfaces that permit a readout speed of up to 500 events/s with the
   whole memory depth of the 4 channels read.}},

Abstract = {{Interactive TV program is made possible by digital television standards.
   MHP, Multimedia Home Platform, is an open standard from DVB for creating
   interactive content application. MHP provides a rich set of application
   programming interface for designer to create various kinds of services
   by direct Java programming. In this paper, we will describe an
   innovative authoring tool for enhancing interactive TV service creation
   environments. A layered scene-and-shot model has been created to
   represent the interactive services content relationship and store in XML
   form. Individual object is mapped to the HA Vi user interface component
   and associated action so that it could response to the TV user's remote
   control action. With online Java code generation and compilation, the
   interactive service can be easily transformed into MHP Xlet application.
   This approach creates a flexible platform architecture that can be used
   to add new features, such as digital rights management and personal
   video recording, to the broadcast service(1).}},

Abstract = {{aAQUA is an online multilingual, multimedia Agricultural portal for
   disseminating information from and to the grassroots of the Indian
   agricultural community. aAQUA simultaneously addresses two major
   challenges in farmer outreach programs - geographic reach and customized
   delivery. It answers farmers queries based on the location, season, crop
   and other information provided by farmers. aAQUA makes use of novel
   database systems and information retrieval techniques like intelligent
   caching, offline access with intermittent synchronization,
   semantic-based search, etc. Agricultural content repositories (Digital
   Library), Agri-price information (Bhav Puchiye), farmer schemes and
   various operations support databases (aAQUA-QoS) have also emerged from
   the experience of aAQUA deployments. aAQUA's large scale deployment
   provides avenues for researchers to contribute in the areas of knowledge
   management, cross- lingual information retrieval, and providing
   accessible content for rural populations. Apart from Agriculture, aAQUA
   can be configured and customized for Expert advice over mobile networks
   and the internet in Education, Healthcare and other domains of interest
   to a developing population. This paper will showcase the utility of
   various component databases built into aAQUA to enhance the QoS
   delivered to rural populations.}},

Abstract = {{The Argaman Virtual Reality Software Suite is an innovative, unique
   solution providing an immersive virtual reality therapeutic system for
   treatment of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in people who
   witnessed or suffered terror attacks or other traumatic experiences. The
   flexible design of the tool enables custom reconstruction of the scenery
   as well as specific events for each patient. The complete treatment
   system projects the therapist into the virtual scene, thus highly
   improving the overall impact of the treatment.
   The system editor rapidly simulates in 3D the audio-visual environment
   where the trauma occurred and provides life-like avatars that imitate
   people in that vicinity. When using the system, the patient can
   gradually process the experience with the help of a professional
   therapist, construct new memories of alternative scenarios, and deal
   with previously suppressed emotions and cognitions.
   A central and unique feature of the system is its ability to insert, in
   real-time, the therapist or other players into the virtual scene, by
   digitally processing a live video stream according to the blue-screen
   technique. This process ensures that the concept of personal care in
   therapy is extended into the virtual world.}},

   a PCbased Control Platform As a front end of the
   field-distributeddata-acquisition system, RAU captures, digitizes and
   stores the EMI signals in its memory and sends the information to the PC
   using the Wireless Data Communication Network. The WDCN acts as a
   bi-directional data communication link between the RAU \& the Control
   platform. It is based on Bluetooth technology and has a
   point-to-multipoint topology. The RAU serves as the acquisition function
   of a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) while the Control Platform
   carries out the display \& control function of a DSO. The whole system,

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, implementation, and commissioning of a
   complete protection and control system retrofit project at a large
   transmission substation. Fort Thompson Substation, located in South
   Dakota, has two 345/230 kV step-down transformers with two 345 kV lines
   and twelve 230 kV lines. Western Area Power Administration (Western)
   undertook a project several years ago to completely renovate all the
   protection and control systems at this substation. They used the
   automation practices that Western had developed to reduce costs of new
   substation construction. While it is easy to cost justify integrating
   and automating systems when building a new substation, it is
   traditionally more difficult to justify automation system upgrade
   schemes when doing a renovation project. However, recent innovations in
   the integration capabilities of microprocessor-based protective relays,
   and other substation IEDs, make a complete integration system upgrade,
   including automation, cost effective compared to selective replacement
   of individual IEDs, wiring, and testing.
   This paper describes the justification and special challenges of
   automating an existing substation. It also discusses the overall system
   design concept of the integration and automation schemes that were
   employed. Topics covered in the paper include:
   Extensive use of fiber-optic cables to replace all control wiring in the
   yard
   Extensive use of multifunctional protection devices to eliminate wiring
   and equipment that would be required in a traditional design
   Replacement of hardwired lockout relays with ``soft{''} logic
   Elimination of hardwired I/O to the RTU
   Project management tools used to ensure completion dates and to maintain
   budget
   Challenges of designing operator interface screens
   Impact on the workforce in migrating to a completely automated
   substation
   Insights gained in testing and commissioning the substation.}},

Abstract = {{The auto-focus method based on digital image processing results from the
   innovation of the traditional auto-focus method Generally speaking, the
   traditional auto-focus method needs extra focus equipment and can be
   disturbed easily by environment factors. So the application of the
   traditional auto-focus method is limited hugely. The auto-focus method
   based on digital image processing is usually achieved by image
   definition evaluation functions. The paper studies the structure of
   two-dimension minimum isotropy wavelet filters and propounds the image
   definition evaluation based on a wavelet filter. In the paper, the
   evaluation function based on the wavelet filter is compared with the
   evaluation function based on the Laplacian operator by using the
   auto-focus system of a microscope. The experiment results indicate that
   the auto-focus algorithm based on the isotropy wavelet filter has good

Abstract = {{Remote Sensing Satellites orbit around the Earth around 600-900
   kilometers in sun synchronous polar orbit. Each satellite transmits the
   image data in X-band and the data reception is carried out through a
   parabolic antenna along with the associated systems. The entire data
   acquisition system is complex and expensive as it has to meet the
   requirements of the fast orbiting remote sensing satellites. During the
   visibility of the satellite, the data is acquired at the acquisition
   systems, frame synchronized band separated and displayed in the monitor
   in real-time. The authors of this Paper used the concept of archiving
   the RAW data directly to Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) in
   Real-time and also to provide on the fly Sub-sampled video image display
   using generic PC Based Linux Servers available in the industry. Handling
   of high speed image data from satellite involves de-randomization,
   decryption and decompression in real time. Innovative multiplexing
   techniques are used for digital correlation to increase the operating
   speed. Effective system design strategies rely on appropriate matching
   of systems hardware, software and environment. This needs the proper
   evaluation of the system environment. Schedulers for a realtime system
   are concerned with maximizing resource utilization subject to meeting
   system timing constraints. Priority-driven presumptive schedulers used
   in realtime systems require predictable cache performance. The design
   involved shared memory concepts, cache memory handling, Image data
   handling and transfer to RAID while each system handles the data of
   around 500 GB per day. The paper deals with a generalized design of such
   system using a common platform as a part of Indian Remote Sensing
   Satellite Program and supplied to many users around the world. These
   systems are working error free all over.}},

Abstract = {{Digital retail payments have evolved during the last years mostly due to
   technology innovations. New actors enter the payments market, increase
   competition and threaten banks' dominance. Consumers' behavior is
   critical within this context, since they are the ones that will finally
   adopt or reject a payment innovation. In this paper we propose a model
   of consumer behavior towards payment system selection based on
   multi-agent simulation. It is based on a multi-agent platform that
   models consumers as intelligent agents and formats their behavior
   according to rules extracted from past payments data, experts' knowledge
   and marketing research. Contributions from social science and network
   economics also refine the agent's behavior in order to simulate
   accurately the domain. This paper presents the overall model and an
   initial analysis of payments domain, defining major actors in the domain
   and their interpretation to agents.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of data, voice and multimedia communication over digital
   networks, coupled with continuous improvement in network capacity and
   reliability has significantly enriched the ways we communicate. However,
   the stovepipe approach used to develop today's communication
   applications and tools results in rigid technology, limited utility,
   lengthy and costly development cycle, difficulty in integration, and
   hinders innovation. In this paper, we present a fundamentally different
   approach, which we call Communication Virtual Machine (CVM) to address
   these problems. CVM provides a user-centric, model-driven approach for
   conceiving, synthesizing and delivering communication solutions across
   application domains. We argue that CVM represents afar more effective
   paradigm for engineering communication solutions. The concept,
   architecture, modeling language, prototypical design and implementation
   of CVM are discussed.}},

   to fundamental techniques of problem solving using a procedural computer
   programming language: C++. Since no prior computer programming
   experience is assumed, one major problem observed in the course is that
   students learn about programming in a somewhat passive pattern. This
   paper proposes to create a blended learning environment utilizing a
   Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach to improve students' programming
   skills. CBR is an innovative instructional approach that utilizes the
   specific knowledge of previously experienced problem situations (cases).
   A new problem can be solved by finding a similar past case and reusing
   it in the new problem situation. Then a new case is retained each time
   when a problem has been solved, making it immediately available for
   future problem.}},

Abstract = {{The term Digital Divide refers to the socioeconomic difference between
   communities in their access to computers and the Internet. Closing the
   digital divide has been considered as national interest and of great
   social benefit. This paper presents an innovative approach in helping
   college students understand the problems and impacts of the digital
   divide through a service learning project. The course hosting the
   service learning project is Computer Mastery with Active Server Pages.
   Our campus is surrounded with schools that have a high percentage of
   minority students, and students from low income families. The service
   learning project sends college students in teams to local schools and
   non-profit organizations to teach computer lessons to those who
   otherwise cannot afford. This paper will describe how such community
   service can be linked to the learning objectives of the course. Impacts
   of the project on all parties involved will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For over ten years Rose-Hulman has required all incoming students to
   purchase an institute-selected laptop computer and an associated suite
   of software. Students use their laptops in classrooms on a daily basis.
   Moire recently, we have begun to ask: What is beyond the laptop
   initiative? One possible answer is a combination of pen-based Tablet PCs
   and interaction-enhancing software like DyKnow Vision. This paper
   reports: our innovative use of DyKnow Vision software and Tablet PCs
   (hereafter, DyKnow/Tablets{''}) to promote active learning in the
   classroom; similarities/differences in our approach across 7 courses
   covering engineering, humanities and science and involving more than
   20\% of Rose-Hulman's students; and studies that assess how,
   DyKnow/Tablets affect student learning. Thus, the paper presents an
   innovative direction that engineering education may take as well as gin
   assessment of some aspects of that direction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a constructivist approach to advanced course
   development in an interdisciplinary field by focusing on a case study at
   the intersection of music and engineering. Engineering approaches to
   music modeling and cognition is a fast growing and rapidly evolving
   focus of study due to the explosion of digital music information. The
   challenges (of designing a course to impart the expertise necessary to
   innovate at the forefront of the field include the lack of a formal body
   of scholarly knowledge in the form of a text, the lack of formal
   structures to support the course in the traditional disciplinary
   framework, the relatively small number of students with suitably strong
   backgrounds in both computing and music, and misconceptions about the
   nature of music research. The paper describes how these obstacles were
   surmounted. An outcome of the course was dissemination of organized
   knowledge and example projects through the web as a resource for the
   community.}},

Abstract = {{For several decades, microelectronic industries and relevant academic
   communities have been spending tremendous effort in developing and
   commercializing the Moore's law, leading to not only many breakthroughs
   and revolution in ICT, but also noticeable changes in the way of living
   of human being. While this trend will still be valid, pushing
   microelectronics to the nanoelectronic era, in recent years, there are
   ever-increasing awareness, R\&D effort and business drivers to speed up
   the development and application of ``More than Moore{''} that are based
   upon or derived from silicon technologies but do not scale with Moore's
   law (with typical examples as RF, Power/HV, Sensor/Actuator/MEMS, SiP,
   SSL, etc.). The future business opportunities and technology challenges
   will be the innovations and effective integration of Moore's law
   focusing mainly on digital function with MtM focusing mainly on
   non-digital function and heterogeneous integration.
   Starting from the rationale of MtM, this paper will highlight some
   strategic research issues of sensors and actuators within the technology
   domain MtM. Some issues related to the paradigm of MtM, covering
   industrial vision, strategy and business models, will also be discussed.}},

   province of South Africa. The project is aimed at providing solutions
   for underprivileged and disadvantaged communities, to help solve some of
   their needs by creating localized computer-based solutions based on
   indigenous knowledge. This will help bridge the digital divide, as these
   computer solutions will be closer to the local users. The project
   entails studying the community in question and understanding their way
   of life and then develop software solutions that use features that they
   are familiar with and use their language. The project Kill ask the
   community to partake in the development of the solution and then reap
   benefits from whatever revenue stream the project will enable. An added
   benefit is that we should be able to preserve the cultural aspects of
   the community while bringing forth best class modernity. Key areas that
   the project will affect are: education, music, artworks, written or
   documented history etc. Younger as well as future generations will have
   a chance to be inventive, innovative and hopefully become the future
   developers and develop their own software solutions.}},

   the building a large area silicon micro-channel plate (MCP) using GaN
   photocathode. In this paper, we will present the design and simulation
   of silicon micro-channel plate with GaN photocathode with large area
   array with 2 micron pores and 3 micron pitch. We will also present
   results for the ICP-RIE process to fabricate 2 micron pores, and Growth
   of high conductivity GaN photocathodes using MOCVD to produce 40\% QE.
   We will also discuss approaches for development of readout architecture
   and circuit for Silicon based MCP 4096x4096 UV FPA. The readout
   architecture scheme uses a series of charge sensitive amplifiers (CSA)
   to boost the charge received on each anode. The signal from each CSA is
   then passed into a shaping amplifier (SA) that produces a smooth
   waveform. The peak of the smoothed waveform is captured by a sample and
   hold (S/H) circuit that holds the signal until an analog to digital
   (A/D) converter can sample it. Details of the ROIC circuit will be
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Underground utility services play an essential role in sustaining urban
   life. The majority of these utility services are delivered through
   pipeline networks, which are mostly buried underground and are
   interconnected through other urban systems to distribute or collect
   basic sustainable needs such as treated water, waste water, gas,
   communication, and power. Deterioration of underground infrastructure
   systems occurs due to ineffective maintenance management practices.
   Because new installation can be very costly and disruptive, the best
   course of action is to maintain the present infrastructure in a more
   effective way to maximize life span and prevent catastrophic failures.
   The accurate evaluation of current underground infrastructure must be
   done before any crucial decisions including lifecycle, rehabilitation
   and replacement intervals, and appropriate remedial methods can be made.
   Unfortunately, traditional technologies and management approaches have
   been limited by the use of insufficient data in the evaluation of the
   structural integrity of an aged infrastructure. This paper describes the
   testing, development, and application of a novel assessment technology,
   which combines in-pipe Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) with Digital
   Scanning and Evaluation Technology (DSET) robotics to collect accurate
   information about the condition of the inside wall of concrete sewer
   pipes. A case study applying this innovative technology to sections of
   large diameter PVC-lined concrete pipe in the City of Phoenix is
   presented. The study and adoption of innovative pipeline assessment
   methods provide better information to improve the decision-making
   process, thereby making economical decisions to optimize resources in
   more efficient ways.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. Innovations in information technology application of
   personalized, tailored feedback strategies for improving dietary
   adherence. We developed and tested a real-time diet-monitoring and
   feedback. system using hand-held computers. The goals were to increase
   diet self-monitoring, reduce the burden of monitoring food intake, and
   increase adherence to dietary goals within a clinical trial.
   Methods. Participants were 33 women. in the Diet. Modification arm of
   the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). After using focus groups to
   determine system features, women used the Personal Digital Assistant
   (PDA)-based system for 1 month and received immediate and weekly
   tailored feedback. The process and outcomes were evaluated using
   real-time food records collected through the PDAs; surveys; and
   self-reported food frequency questionnaires.
   Results. Participants significantly increased self-monitoring, improved
   their attitudes toward self-monitoring, and, met their dietary goals
   more often. Reported total fat intake and percent energy from fat
   decreased significantly. There was a modest decrease in mean caloric
   intake..
   Discussion. The pilot study findings support the largely untapped
   potential of handheld, computers for improving diet, monitoring and diet
   adherence, particularly within a clinical trial.}},

Abstract = {{Inductor current sensing is becoming widely used in current programmed
   controllers for microprocessor applications. This method exploits a
   low-pass filter in parallel with the inductor to provide lossless
   current sense. A major drawback of inductor current sensing is that
   accurate sense the DC and AC components of the current signal requires
   precise matching between the low-pass filter time constant and the
   inductor time constant (L/R-L). However, matching accuracy depends on
   the tolerance of the components and on the operating conditions;
   therefore it can hardly be guaranteed. To overcome this problem, a novel
   digital auto-tuning system is proposed that automatically compensates
   any time constant mismatch. This auto-tuning system has been developed
   for VRM current programmed controllers. It makes it possible to meet the
   Adaptive Voltage Positioning requirements using conventional and low
   cost components, and to solve problems such as aging effects,
   temperature variations and process tolerances as well. A prototype of
   the auto-tuning system based on an FPGA and a commercial DC/DC
   controller has been designed and tested. The experimental results fully
   confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing an
   improvement of the current sense precision from about 30\% up to 4\%.
   This innovative solution is suitable to fulfill the challenging accuracy
   specifications required by the future VRM applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative approach for the hardware
   implementation of neural networks (NN's) in power electronics
   applications. Effective NN-based applications in power electronics
   require hardware implementations that exploit the inherent parallelism
   of NN's. Nonetheless, most NN hardware implementations have been
   realized using digital signal processors (DSP) or computers that offer
   serial processing. Nowadays, parallel programmable logic devices, such
   as the field programmable gate array (FPGA) with embedded
   microprocessors, have become powerful hardware options, offering low
   cost, high execution speed, reconfigurability and parallelism. This work
   intends to exploit the current available resources in commercial FPGAs
   to implement NN-based controllers for power electronics applications.
   Simulation and experimental results included in this paper show the
   viability of exploiting the parallelism and modularity of a low cost
   FPGA to implement a NN-based controller for a buck converter.}},

Abstract = {{An autonomous music composition tool is developed using Genetic
   Algorithms. The composition is conducted in two Stages. The first Stage
   generates and identifies musically sound patterns (motifs). In the
   second Stage, methods to combine different generated motifs and their
   transpositions are applied. These combinations are evaluated and as a
   result, musically fit phrases are generated. Four musical phrases are
   generated at the end of each program run. The generated music pieces
   will be translated into Guido Music Notation (GMN) and alternate
   representation in Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). The
   Autonomous Evolutionary Music Composer (AEMC) was able to create
   interesting pieces of music that were both innovative and musically
   sound.}},

Abstract = {{Now is the time to migrate tape-based media archives to digital
   file-based archives for television broadcasters. These archives not only
   address the issue of tape-deterioration, they also create new
   possibilities for opening up the archive. However, the switch from
   tape-based to file-based is something only the very big television
   broadcasters can manage individually. Outer- broadcasters should work
   together to accomplish this task. In the Flemish part of Belgium, the
   two largest broadcasters in Flanders, namely the commercial broadcaster
   VMMa and the public broadcaster VRT, the television facilities
   supporting company Videohouse, and different university research groups
   associated with the Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology
   joined forces and started the ``Innovative Platform on Electronic
   Archiving{''} project. The goal of this project is to develop common
   standards for the exchange and archiving of audio-visual data. In this
   paper, we give a detailed overview of this project and its different
   research topics.}},

Abstract = {{Even though companies that assess pavement condition compete to innovate
   by providing better software for automatic analysis and diagnosis, the
   industry as a whole remains limited, and data collection and storage
   methods are disparate. In fact, software and handling procedures are
   proprietary-each vendor has its own automated technology to detect,
   classify, and quantify surface distresses. In a research effort
   sponsored by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, Canada, the
   performance of sensor- and image-based pavement condition assessment was
   compared. First, a data management plan was created to allow efficient
   data manipulation. Second, a suitable set of similar distresses was
   selected as response variables of interest to design and conduct
   statistical experiments. Third, advanced analysis of variance was
   performed to allow statistical data comparisons among companies and
   among automated technologies. Finally, results were discussed and
   recommendations made. Overall, service provider measurements using
   sensor-based equipment showed no significant differences; however, those
   taken with digital image technology did. The implications of such
   outcomes, including implementation details to encourage practitioners to
   benefit from these preliminary results, are discussed. More broadly,
   road agencies are given an opportunity to revisit selection decisions
   concerning the acceptance or rejection of pavement data collected by a
   range of contractors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider how digital resources
   might best be created and how the digital medium might best be exploited
   to serve the needs of research and teaching in the humanities.
   Design/methodology/approach - The history of text-based humanities
   computing is traced to illustrate the complexity of humanities sources
   and the requirements for their representation in digital form.
   Findings - The paper finds that digital information is completely
   different from any other kind of information, being dynamic, extensible
   and manipulable in many different ways. It is not static and it can be
   manipulated in many different ways. The Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   has been widely adopted in the humanities particularly for full text
   sources encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative application.
   XML permits the display, analysis and manipulation of fine detail within
   a document. It also facilitates the chunking of information and the
   integration of data and metadata leading to new forms of publication
   that exploit the digital medium to the full.
   Research limitations/implications - The research environment proposed in
   this paper challenges current modes of working with a more innovative
   approach to the nature and functionality of digital representations of
   humanities sources.
   Originality/value - The paper looks at the development of humanities
   computing and should be helpful for anyone embarking on or managing a
   humanities digital project.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a system which automatically detects moving targets
   contained in aerial sequences of FLIR images under heavy cluttered
   conditions. In these situations, the detection of moving targets is
   generally carried out through the implementation of segmentation and
   tracking techniques based on the images correlation maintained by the
   static camera hypothesis. However, detection procedures cannot rely on
   this correlation when the camera is airborne and, therefore, image
   stabilization techniques are usually introduced previously to the
   detection process. Nevertheless, the use of stabilization algorithms has
   been often applied to terrestrial sequences and assuming a high
   computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose an
   innovative and efficient strategy, with a block-based estimation and an
   affine transformation, operating on a multi-resolution approach for
   recovering from the ego-motion. Next, once the images have been
   compensated on the highest resolution image and refined to avoid
   distortions produced in the sampling process, a dynamic
   differences-based segmentation followed by a morphological filtering
   strategy is applied. The novelty of our strategy relies on the
   relaxation of the pre-assumed hypothesis and, hence, on the enhancement
   of its applicability, and also by further reducing its computational
   cost, thanks to the application of a multi-resolution algorithm. The
   experiments performed have obtained excellent results and, although the
   complexity of the system arises, the application of the multi-resolution
   approach has proved to dramatically reduce the global computational
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a mobile application, which was originally designed
   as an extension for the PotatoSystem {[}1], which is a distribution
   system for virtual goods with the focus on digital music. Its innovative
   idea is that buyers can become resellers and earn a provision for
   redistributing purchased files. With the ``Mobile Music Messenger{''}, a
   J2ME application for modern mobile phones, users can find other users
   with similar musical taste to sell them own songs or to find new
   pleasing music for themselves. The distributed recommendation algorithm
   uses the peer-to-peer system JATA while avoiding a central database.
   Users may pre-listen recommended songs and contact each other. These
   functions are embedded in a music chat system, whose future enhancements
   will be covered as well. The application can be extended to function for
   all mobile music providers. The mobile users of all partaking mobile
   music stores will become mobile affiliate community.}},

   of search results drawing on heterogeneous conceptual frameworks,
   metadata structures, naming devices and end-user requirements. We
   describe the development and testing of a two-tier semantic mediating
   device to support searches of multiple cross-cultural metadata-enabled

   linking different content metadata schemes, while a topic map-enabled
   search interface facilitates the access of digital objects in diverse

Abstract = {{Optical waveguide writing with femtosecond laser pulses represents a
   good alternative to traditional fabrication methods thanks to its
   simplicity, flexibility and possibility to realize 3D structures. The
   direct use of a laser oscillator allows a simpler setup, without
   amplification stages, greater processing speed, up to 1 cm/s, and
   intrinsically symmetric waveguide cross-sections due to isotropic heat
   diffusion.
   In this work we report on the fabrication and optical characterization
   of waveguides at telecom wavelengths by a stretched-cavity (26 MHz
   repetition rate) Ti:Sapphire oscillator. The best results have been
   obtained on Corning 0211 and the previously unexplored Schott IOG10.
   Operation at 1.55-micron is demonstrated and a comparison between
   optical properties of the waveguides on the two glasses is made. The
   refractive index profiles have been measured with two different
   techniques: the innovative Digital Holography Microscopy (DHM), applied
   for the first time to optical waveguides, and near-field refractive
   index profilometry (RNF). The shape of the refractive index profile was
   found to depend strongly on the glass type.
   We demonstrate passive photonic devices at 1.55-micron, exploiting the
   unique 3D capabilities of the technique. These devices include: (i) a
   1x2 splitter, obtained by writing two straight waveguides at an angle
   and separated by a depth displacement; (ii) a 1x4 splitter, realized by
   combining 1x2 splitters on different planes in the depth; (iii) a WDM
   coupler, with a good rejection of the 980-nm signal with respect to the
   1550-nm one. Perspectives of the technique will also be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{This study designed an alternative Chinese keyboard layout for
   single-digit typists and evaluated the efficacy of this innovative
   layout design. The new eight row by five column keyboard layout was
   designed based on the principles of alternative keyboard design. Eight
   college students with proficient keyboarding were involved in this
   study. The repeated measurement experimental design was used to compare
   the speed and accuracy of keystroke among the four different keyboard
   patterns: QWERTY, Alternative, Revised-QWERTY, and Random-Altemative.
   The experimental results indicated that the subjects' typing speed is
   fastest when utilizing the QWERTY layout (63.86 symbols/minute),
   followed by the Alternative (56.02 symbol s/minute), Revised QWERTY
   (53.39 symbols/minute) and the Random-Altemative keyboard (49.94
   symbols/minute). There is no significant difference among QWERTY,
   Alternative, Revised-QWERTY, and Random-Altemative layouts on the
   subjects' typing accuracy. The possible causes of the unpredicted
   results and suggestions for further studies were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of distributed sampling and compression in sensor
   networks when the sensors are digital cameras that acquire a 3-D visual
   scene of interest from different viewing positions, We assume that
   sensors cannot communicate among themselves, but can process their
   acquired data and transmit it to a common central receiver. The main
   task of the receiver is then to reconstruct the best possible estimation
   of the original scene and the natural issue, in this context, is to
   understand the interplay in the reconstruction between sampling and
   distributed compression.
   In this paper, we show that if the observed scene belongs to the class
   of signals that can be represented with a finite number of parameters,
   we can determine the minimum number of sensors that allows perfect
   reconstruction of the scene. Then, we present a practical distributed
   coding approach that leads to a rate-distortion behaviour at the decoder
   that is independent of the number of sensors, when this number increases
   beyond the critical sampling. In other words, we show that the
   distortion at the decoder does not depend on the number of sensors used,
   but only on the total number of bits that can be transmitted from the
   sensors to the receiver.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) technologies provide novel and enhanced modes of
   human computer interaction that can be used to overcome communication
   drawbacks that prevail in conventional computer aided design (CAD)
   systems in the support of conceptual design, principally in concept
   generation and evaluation. The work reported here focuses on how VR
   technologies can proffer more natural and intuitive interaction between
   the designer and the CAD system thus enabling a rapid and more
   straightforward approach to concept design creation and evaluation. As
   the result of this research, an innovative conceptual design system
   called the LUCID system has been developed. LUCID provides designers
   with a new interaction paradigm that enables them to take fuller
   advantage of their visual, auditory and tactile sensorial channels in
   order to create, view, touch, manipulate and listen to CAD digital
   models more effectively. The LUCID system has shown particular human
   computer interface (HCI) benefits to designers during conceptual design
   stages based on the outcome from a user evaluation test. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{There are two innovations which have drastically changed the building
   process: the operational continuity of the design and construction
   phases, and the software allowing not only the representation but also
   the autonomous creation of complex shapes never before thought of just
   because they could not be represented. This last innovation gave rise to
   a new design paradigm whose tools, according to their supporters, are
   the most advanced fields of mathematics and information science. Some
   ways of using these new possibilities gave rise to a radical,
   problematic, change in the relationship net between the designer's
   intentions, the shapes through which they express them (invented or
   self-generated) and their semantic contents. The most radical position
   skips the problem denying the necessity of such a semantic content. A
   further question is raised when the context is thought to intervene
   directly in the shaping process of a building envelope.
   Translating cultural influences into physical entities directly acting
   in transforming surfaces shapes entails a strongly idiosyncratic
   interpretation. Constructing a semantic code of shapes and context
   forces common to the sender (the architect that decides the shape) and
   the receiver of the communication (the social community in which the
   architecture is immersed) requires from the former a careful reflection
   on the meanings also beyond the sender's intentions, with which the
   community reads the designed shapes, according to its cultural standard.
   The complexity of those processes has for a long time been the object of
   much debate. Some statements about the new paradigm seem to be metaphors
   rather than realities. Our contribution tries to detect some
   misunderstandings which a displaced use of some concepts has created
   have this nature. A design experiment is presented, that has been used
   as a test.}},

   demonstrated in this study to emphasize the user's initiative in
   actuating smart services in space. By the metaphor of WIMP (i.e. Window,
   Icon, Mouse and Popup-menu) inherited from computer desktop GUI,
   electronic services and digital information are bundled into physical
   objects in smart space. For implementation, versatile IT technology and
   spatial setting are integrated in laboratory, including the RFID, Wi-Fi
   802.11 and IR network for context-sensing, device-controlling and
   service actuation. Through the evaluation in lab demo scenarios, the
   findings are as follows: (1) the cognitive mapping structure between
   digital and physical objects derives innovative research issues in
   user's spatial representation and object labelling for both individuals
   and groups; (2) the real-time mapping between spatial setting and user
   status abstracted from sensing network provides rich support for direct

Abstract = {{ReActivities (c) are digital play sequences which encourage the
   integration of social, emotional and cognitive development in children
   on the autistic spectrum. High levels of anxiety in autistic children
   can inhibit playful experiences and increase the rigid, stereotypical
   and challenging behaviours which have a negative effect in social
   situations. Interactions with objects that offer repetition, pattern and
   similarity combined with colour and rhythm are regularly used by
   autistic children as methods to reduce anxiety. However little has been
   done to interpret these sensations in digital environments. The aim of
   ReActivities (c) has been to offer a rich physical and cognitive
   experience which simulates the perceptible characteristics of phenomena
   such as elasticity, velocity, gravity and inertia. This is an advanced
   form of cause and effect that promises a unique form of expression in
   response to exploration with computer technology. There are numerous
   thoughtful and engaging websites designed and maintained by autistic
   people which are testimony to the theory that computers, and
   particularly electronic networks, offer enormous possibilities for
   creativity, communication and fun. The project is utilising open source
   technology to enable autistic users, many of whom are already conversant
   with programming languages, to adapt and re-generate the software.
   Fostering a community approach to development affords further
   opportunities to explore an innovative, inclusive design method that,
   should it prove successful, could provide a model for other marginalised
   groups.}},

   internal. Rather than using technology to replicate the rigid goals and
   structures of many conventional games, this game explores the concept of
   `open play', a form of personal exploration. The work is an

   scientists with an agenda to alter players' attitudes to the body and

Abstract = {{The issue of color is now receiving. considerable attention in the
   applications of imaging technology. It is difficult to reproduce the
   original color of subject in conventional imaging systems, and it
   obstructs the applications of visual communication systems in
   telemedicine, electronic commerce, and digital museum. Recently, the
   color videos, still-images, and prints are reproduced with significantly
   better quality than before, but there still remain limitations imposed
   by RGB trichromatic system. To breakthrough the limitation of RGB
   3-primary systems, ``Natural Vision{''} system has been developed aiming
   at an innovative visual communication technology, which enables
   high-fidelity color reproduction, based on spectral information. The
   experimental multispectral systems for both still-image and video have
   been elaborated and shown following features of spectrum-based scheme;
   a) Highly accurate color reproduction is possible with multispectral
   imaging, even under different illumination environment. b) Extended
   color gamut can be reproduced by multiprimary color displays. c) The
   influence of observer metamerism, which is considered as a cause of
   color disagreement between different media, can be reduced by the
   spectral color reproduction. d) The quantitative spectral attributes of
   object, useful for the analysis or the recognition of object, are
   captured and preserved. In addition, the effectiveness of the system has
   been demonstrated through experiments in the application fields, such as
   medicine, digital archives, color printing, electronic commerce, and
   computer graphics.}},

Abstract = {{Generated from an assignment for a digital fabrication class at the
   Syracuse University School of Architecture, this project demonstrates
   how the simple application of digital fabrication techniques to everyday
   materials can create innovative construction methods and expose the
   potential for new architectural design.
   The assignment called for a wall to be constructed solely out of paper,
   twelve feet in length and at least eight feet high using the principles
   of digital fabrication.
   From the very outset, our understanding of the problem was simple: paper
   does not resist any load applied in plane when it is left unmodified, it
   merely buckles. However, as soon as a single sheet of paper is folded
   its ability to resist load increases dramatically. It then became an
   exercise in testing combinations of folded paper to maximize both
   compressive strength as well as lateral stability, the final result
   being the simplification of previous iterations.}},

Abstract = {{Most digital cameras acquire data through a Bayer Colour Filter Array
   (CFA) placed on sensors where each pixel element records intensity
   information of only one colour component. The colour image is then
   produced through a pipeline of image processing algorithms which
   restores the subsampled components. In the last few years the wide
   diffusion of Digital Still Cameras (DSC) and mobile imaging devices
   disposes to develop new coding techniques able to save resources needed
   to store and to transmit Bayer pattern data. This paper introduces an
   innovative coding method that allows achieving compression by Vector
   Quantization (VQ) applied to prediction errors, among adjacent pixel of
   Bayer Pattern source, computed by a Differential Pulse Code Modulation
   (DPCM)-like algorithm. The proposed method allows a visually lossless

Abstract = {{Standardization is a key issue in information systems research and a
   theoretical as well as practical challenge for electronic commerce and
   the digital economy. Inherent in standards, the commonality property
   deriving from the need for compatibility implies coordination problems
   that are characteristic of information systems. From a theoretical
   perspective, the existence of network effects renders efficient
   neoclassical solutions improbable. As a consequence, corporate
   information management is increasingly occupied with coordinating
   standardization decisions as a basis for information and communication
   infrastructures.
   In this work, a standardization framework based on an analysis of
   network effect theory and computer-based simulations is developed and
   applied to corporate standardization problems. A fundamental finding is
   the existence of a standardization gap quantifying the magnitude of the
   standardization problem. A practical application of the framework
   empirically shows the size of a concrete standardization gap and how
   strategies can be developed internalizing this unrealized efficiency
   potential.}},

   This paper shows a solution to integrate the MCAD and ECAD data by
   introducing new Digital-Mock-Up (DMU) tools which are capable to
   visualize the exact electrical components geometry as well as the
   mechanical geometry within one 3D -representation. It is crucial for a
   successful implementation of such a Mechanic-Electric-DMU-system
   (ME-DMU) that the functions are based on a common PDM system.}},

Abstract = {{Capability assessment can play an important role in the digital
   government domain in at least two ways: one is to provide a basis for
   judging whether agencies are ready to initiate some digital government
   innovation, and the other is to judge the impact of a digital government
   initiative in terms of improved capabilities. The problems of how to
   assess and enhance organizational capability are therefore central to
   virtually all efforts to improve government performance, particularly in
   the area of information technology innovation. This paper describes the
   approach used in developing a set of toolkits for use in assessing
   capability, with examples from versions developed for use in justice
   information integration projects and state-level digital preservation
   planning in the US. The paper includes the theoretical rationale for the
   design of the toolkits, methods for their use, and implications for use
   in practice.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{121-125}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to track the uses of humans for
   document search and retrieval into the now increasing problem of
   accessing electronic information.
   Design/methodology/approach - Search has evolved into a top priority for
   internet users and will continue to expand as the new application
   platform. In the last year, Google has become the superstar of finding
   and accessing digital information. Information fracture, the multiplying
   effect of information processing, continues to send shock waves across
   computing environments.
   Findings - Computing has shifted to distributed systems delivering from
   the network, not the local storage device. Locating a particular digital
   item is difficult. Google and other search engine companies are becoming
   application platforms. Google provides applications on different devices
   at different price points, including free of charge, with a variety of
   technology infrastructure. Innovations will be driven by user behavior.
   Research limitations/implications - Electronic information is doubling
   every 12 to 18 months. Search will drive the future of next-generation
   applications. Publishing is already feeling the impact of this new shock
   wave. What is next may not be known yet, but Google already has 60
   products and services out.
   Originality/value - This paper shows the evolution of information in
   search and retrieval methods, and how search will drive next-generation
   applications. Google is the primary market maker, with more patents
   applied for in the first six months of 2005 than all of its previous
   history, going back to 1998.}},

Title = {{Using data mining technology to solve classification problems - A case
   study of campus digital library}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{307-321}},
Abstract = {{Purpose- Traditional library catalogs have become inefficient and
   inconvenient in assisting library users. Readers may spend a lot of time
   searching library materials via printed catalogs. Readers need an
   intelligent and innovative solution to overcome this problem. The paper
   seeks to examine data mining technology which is a good approach to
   fulfill readers' requirements.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data mining is considered to be the
   non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially
   useful information from data. This paper analyzes readers' borrowing
   records using the techniques of data analysis, building a data
   warehouse, and data mining.
   Findings - The paper finds that after mining data, readers can be
   classified into different groups according to the publications in which
   they are interested. Some people on the campus also have a greater
   preference for multimedia data.
   Originality/value - The data mining results shows that all readers can
   be categorized into five clusters, and each cluster has its own
   characteristics. The frequency with which graduates and associate
   researchers borrow multimedia data is much higher. This phenomenon shows
   that these readers have a higher preference for accepting digitized
   publications. Also, the number of readers borrowing multimedia data has
   increased over the years. This trend indicates that readers preferences
   are gradually shifting towards reading digital publications.}},

Title = {{A new efficient approach for data clustering in electronic library using

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Traditional library catalogs have become inefficient and
   inconvenient in assisting library users. Readers may spend much time in
   searching library materials via printed catalogs. Readers need an
   intelligent and innovative solution to overcome this problem. The
   purpose of this paper is to illustrate how data mining technology is a
   good approach to fulfill readers' requirements.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data mining is considered to be the
   nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially
   useful information from data. This paper analyzes the readers' borrowing
   records by using the following techniques: data analysis, building data
   warehouse and data mining.
   Findings - The mining results show that all readers can be categorized
   into five clusters, and each cluster has its own characteristics. It was
   also found that the frequency for graduates and associate researchers to
   borrow multimedia data is much higher. This phenomenon shows that these
   readers have a higher preference for accepting digitized publication.
   Besides, we notice that more readers borrow multimedia data rise in
   years. This up trend indicates that readers are gradually shifting their
   preference in reading digital publications.
   Originality/value - The paper proposes a technique to discover clusters
   by using ant colony methods.}},

   Wireless LAN (WLAN), designed for the most common standards, integrated
   in digital CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. It covers 802.11a/b/g
   specifications, concurrently working in the 2.5GHz and 5-6GHz frequency
   ranges. An innovative solution for the design of the LC tank allows to
   use a single-spiral inductor in dual resonant tank, with a strong
   reduction in die area. The dual band RF transmitter size is only 1mm(2),
   the smallest ever reported in literature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new circuit solution to implement a high signal
   swing amplifier for driving a low resistive and high capacitive load.
   The amplifier is dedicated to operate at a supply voltage of 2.5 V
   driving an eatpiece device of a mobile phone by the usage of a standard
   digital single gate oxide transistor in a 65nm Technology. The high
   linearity is achieved by using a three stage amplifier. To handle the
   high voltage of 2.5V with the 1.2V transistor an innovative transistor
   cascoding is implemented A Class AB output stage is chosen to ensure a
   low power consumption. A prototype is realized in a low power 65nm CMOS
   Technology. The measured THD is lower than 0.04\% at the desired audio
   band of 20kHz.}},

Title = {{ADSL transceivers applying DSM and their nonstationary noise robustness}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON APPLIED SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2006}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) comprises a new set of techniques for
   multiuser power allocation and/or detection in digital subscriber line
   (DSL) networks. At the Alcatel Research and Innovation Labs, we have
   recently developed a DSM test bed, which allows the performance of DSM
   algorithms to be evaluated in practice. With this test bed, we have
   evaluated the performance of a DSM level-1 algorithm known as iterative
   water-filling in an ADSL scenario. This paper describes the results of,
   on the one hand, the performance gains achieved with iterative
   water-filling, and, on the other hand, the nonstationary noise
   robustness of DSM-enabled ADSL modems. It will be shown that DSM trades
   off nonstationary noise robustness for performance improvements. A new
   bit swap procedure is then introduced to increase the noise robustness
   when applying DSM. Copyright (C) 2006 Hindawi Publishing Corporation.

Abstract = {{The digital divide is a concept generally defined as an inequality in
   access and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   between individuals, households, businesses, geographic areas and
   countries, and reflects a number of differences between and within
   countries (OECD, 2001, p. 5). The aim of this paper is to analyse the
   main characteristics of the digital divide in Europe's rural
   enterprises. Using logit analysis, we examine the factors influencing
   the uptake of ICTs of 996 innovative firms from 10 European rural
   regions. Although significant portions of the divide can be attributed
   to north-south differences, national or even regional characteristics
   should be taken into consideration to arrive at a more meaningful and
   complete typology of the phenomenon. However, it appears that spatial
   attributes provide a more or less static view of the phenomenon.
   Sectoral, firm size, as well as network intensity, to mention only a
   few, considerations, could allow us a greater understanding, not only of
   causes, but also of processes leading to the alleviation, and quite
   often the permeating of the divide. Nevertheless, it appears that among
   the factors that influence the uptake of ICTs, the characteristics of
   human capital are the most significant ones. The paper is based on a
   research project (Labrianidis et al., 2002), financed by the European
   Union.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores key sets of drivers of development of electronic
   business in transition economies with particular reference to recent
   developments in Lithuania. Information and communication technologies
   (ICT) centered on the Internet are today widely recognized as one of the
   driving forces in the transition toward a new economic system. This
   transition has been especially challenging for European transition
   economies that are in the midst of a historic restructuring in
   anticipation of entry into the European Union. These countries are
   confronting an historic challenge of converging to the economic,
   technological, and organizational practices and standards of their EU
   counterparts. ICT applications in the form of e-business provide an
   unique opportunity for companies in these economies to accelerate
   learning processes for the facilitation of the adoption and
   implementation of competitive and sustainable e-business strategies. A
   key challenge in this respect is how to develop electronic business that
   bridge civil society and organizations of the public sector in ways that
   support the transition toward an ICT-enabled economic system.
   The central thesis of this paper is that electronic business are a
   central component of an emerging economic system that is powered by ICT,
   is knowledge-driven, is organized around electronic and organisational
   networks that generate knowledge which transform industries and markets,
   and is dependent on dynamic and flexible regulatory public institutions.
   For ICT to diffuse throughout the whole economy in a way that supports
   virtual community formation, business firms, market conditions, and the
   culture and institutions of society need to undergo substantial change
   in a coordinated manner. It is the dynamic interdependence of these
   conditions that is the source of innovation and value creation in the
   new knowledge-driven economy. The agenda of research on the dynamics of
   adoption of new economy practices, innovation, and economic growth, as a
   result, needs to be expanded beyond the level of the firm. It needs to
   be built around the dynamic interrelationships between technological
   transformations, firms' organizational and knowledge-creating
   capabilities, emerging market and industry structures, and public
   institutions {[}Castells, 2000].
   The paper situates drivers of electronic business and the necessity of
   coordination their development on four levels: the level of ICT
   infrastructure, political-legal environment and e-business development
   support initiatives, human recourses, e-business in enterprises and
   market or civic attitudes toward ICT-enabled market transactions. On
   each of these levels the observations made are conditioned by the
   definitional parameters of `electronic business'. For the purposes of
   this paper, electronic business is defined as business that is
   conducted, in a whole or in part, through digital infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic commerce(EC) has been growing rapidly and is becoming a
   necessity of future business development, which has positive impact on
   improving the economic efficiency. Based on the early research about
   ``the Productivity Paradox `` of information technology and the economic
   efficiency theory, this paper aims at defining the notion of EC's
   economic efficiency and analyzing the mechanism of EC's economic
   efficiency. We find that EC improves the economic efficiency through
   decreasing transaction cost and realizing its network effect. EC's
   economic efficiency is decided by the EC efficiency of within firm, the
   EC efficiency of among firms the efficiency of digital market and the
   efficiency of government supervising EC. At the same time, there are
   demanded on institutional innovations of firm, market, industry and
   government.}},

Abstract = {{New Media includes a range of new delivery and display platforms; among
   them are the World Wide Web, interactive digital television, mobile
   technologies, interactive hyperlinked mapping services, and enhanced
   mapping packages that are ``linked{''} to large databases-national or
   global (Cartwright et al. 2001). New Media now provides a unique
   conglomerate media form for representing geospatial information in
   innovative ways. The many cartographic products developed and published
   using New Media illustrate the enthusiasm with which the geospatial
   science community has embraced it as a tool for representing geography.
   It is argued that this `new' method of access to and representation of
   geospatial information is different to aforeused methods and therefore,
   whilst New Media applications can be considered to be at a fairly
   immature stage of development (compared to paper maps - here paper maps
   have a 500 years or so `start' on electronic counterparts), much
   research has been undertaken to develop strategies for `best practice'
   so as to overcome any deficiencies. This chapter gives an overview of
   how multimedia / hypermedia mapping has developed using discrete,
   distributed, mobile and ubiquitous media and devices. It provides an
   overview of the applications of New Media tools and communications
   systems that cartography has adopted / adapted to deliver timely and
   appropriate geoinformation. It provides examples of the use of discrete
   interactive multimedia, distributed interactive multimedia, and
   delivered via the World Wide Web (Web) or via intranets and mobile
   information delivery applications. Finally, it looks at how the concept
   of ubiquitous computing might be used to facilitate a `different'
   paradigm for geographical information delivery.}},

Abstract = {{We are implementing the second-generation CCD/Transit Instrument
   (CTI-II), a unique 1.8-m imaging astrometric and photometric telescope.
   We discuss design aspects of CTI-II, including the optical system,
   structure, focal plane mosaic and the detector readout system that
   allows precise astrometric and photometric measurements. The scientific
   design drivers for the imaging telescope include discovery and
   measurement of motion and distance for late M, L and T stars, synoptic
   photometric monitoring of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and discovery
   and near real-time spectroscopic follow-up of distant supernovae and AGN
   outbursts. These projects drive the design of the wide field-of-view
   stationary telescope that employs the time-delay and integrate (TDI)
   readout mode for CCD detectors to produce a deep, multicolor image of
   the sky every clear night. Nightly observation of the same strip of the
   sky produces the time domain photometric and repeated astrometric
   measurements required by the science drivers. The telescope, its focal
   plane mosaic and the data system all incorporate unique and innovative
   elements that support an unbiased survey of the sky with intensive
   time-domain sampling. We review these aspects of the project, and
   describe steps taken to support the astrometric and photometric
   precision required by the scientific mission of the telescope.}},

Abstract = {{Digital holography is greatly extending the range of holography's
   applications and moving it from the lab into the field: a single CCD or
   other solid-state sensor can capture any number of holograms while
   numerical reconstruction within a computer eliminates the need for
   chemical development and readily allows farther processing and
   visualisation of the holographic image. The steady increase in sensor
   pixel count leads to the possibilities of larger sample volumes, while
   smaller-area pixels enable the practical use of digital off-axis
   holography. However this increase in pixel count also drives a
   corresponding expansion of the computational effort needed to
   numerically reconstruct such holograms to an extent where the
   reconstruction process for a single depth slice takes significantly
   longer than the capture process for each single hologram. Grid computing
   - a recent innovation in large-scale distributed processing - provides a
   convenient means of harnessing significant computing resources in an
   ad-hoc fashion that might match the field deployment of a holographic
   instrument. We describe here the reconstruction of digital holograms on
   a trans-national computational Grid with over 10 000 nodes available at
   over 100 sites. A simplistic scheme of deployment was found to provide
   no computational advantage over a single powerful workstation. Based on
   these experiences we suggest an improved strategy for workflow and job
   execution for the replay of digital holograms on a Grid.}},

Abstract = {{Partial Discharge is the breakdown confined to the localized regions of
   the insulating medium. The analysis and classification of Partial
   Discharge based on its site of occurrence is a complex process
   notwithstanding the intricacies involved in the digital computer
   acquisition system, since partial discharge is inherently a stochastic
   and a non-Makovian process in which there can be significant statistical
   variability. Since each defect has a particular deterioration mechanism,
   it is imperative to discern the correlation between the discharge
   patterns and the nature of defect in order to ascertain the quality of
   insulation. Neural Network which is a non-parametric method, has been a
   recent innovative technique suitable for partial discharge pattern
   classification. The Back Propagation Algorithm Neural Network is
   verified and validated for the various inputs based on established
   validation techniques. As against the conventional technique of using
   mathematical descriptors adopted by, previous researchers, unique
   characteristic input feature vectors have been devised in this work in
   order to provide a possible solution to a simple yet an effective
   preprocessing methodology. The efficacy of the classification of the
   standard partial discharge defect sources has been evaluated and
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a growing class of SOCs has emerged for mobile
   applications, such as portable desktops, digital pens, audio- and
   video-based multimedia products, wireless communications and imaging
   systems, personal digital assistants, personal communicators and smart
   cards. These SOCs demand high-speed, high-throughput computations,
   complex functionalities and often real-time processing capabilities. The
   performance of these SOCs is mostly limited by lifetime of batteries.
   Thus, new design approaches and methodologies that produce more
   power-efficient and higher throughput designs are greatly desired.
   In recent years, the use of SIMD (single instruction multiple data) or
   MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data) architectures is spreading
   into the general DSP domain due to recent innovations that boost
   performance and flexibility of the architectures by several orders of
   magnitude. The Processor-in-Memory (PIM) environment provides a unique
   prospective because the impact of low-power techniques on performance is
   more sensitive in PIM than in standard RAM. The performance balancing in
   PIM architectures plays a critical role. Even though PIM concept is not
   new, recent breakthroughs pushed the application domain from traditional
   multimedia use to general signal processing use. This tutorial provides
   a unique overview and prospective of these recent developments to a much
   broader audience. The tutorial covers recent developments presented in
   literature and the most recent advances proposed by the author and his
   research group. The focus and objective of the tutorial is on critical
   concepts and circuit techniques that result in significant savings of
   active and standby power in random-access memories coupled with
   significantly improved throughput efficiency (throughput per MHz).
   Specifically, the following topics are covered in the tutorial:
   - a brief overview of RAM-based PIM architectures, - sources of active
   and standby power dissipation in RAMs and embedded datapaths, - AC and
   DC power reduction techniques, - pulse operation techniques, - new
   current-mode low-power sensing and other sensing techniques, - circuit
   level and system level waste-power suppression, - new advances in
   low-power datapath design, - new architectures for fast addition in
   sliceable PIMs.}},

   modulation schemes such as binary phase-shift keying (PSK), quaternary
   PSK, 8-PSK, 16-amplitude PSK (APSK), and 32-APSK. As a result, LDPC

Title = {{Diffusion of selected concepts in information systems and management:
   1973-2004}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the extent to which the
   diffusion of concepts related to information systems and management
   approximates the rate and the cumulative frequency distribution patterns
   assumed to reflect the diffusion of innovations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The diffusion of those concepts was
   measured via citation analysis of 4,014 publications (journal articles,
   books, and dissertations) for the period 1973-2004.
   Findings - Two key findings emerged from the study. First, the
   cumulative frequency distribution approximates the S-curve of adoption.
   Second, the rate of adoption is exponential and corroborates an
   epidemiological model of the rate of adoption recently reported in the
   literature.
   Research limitations/implications - Further research is needed to
   identify and examine topics or concepts that have run their course and
   subsequently offer an excellent opportunity to perform ex-post-facto
   studies on the life cycle of innovative concepts or topics. From these
   studies will be baseline data and easily identifiable ``actors{''} in
   the diffusion process (authors, editors, reviewers, and dissertation
   committees) that will provide the impetus for continued, progressively
   complex research models.
   Practical implications - The practical implications of a deeper
   understanding of the diffusion of innovations are immense. It will
   enhance understanding of how to better promote research and development
   and technology transfer. It will enhance understanding of how better to
   market the fruits of those endeavors.
   Originality/value - This paper's findings bring to the scholarly
   community in the digital era the importance of understanding how new
   concepts and theories are brought to light and evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents a case study of the use of interactive digital
   television (iDTV) to deliver electronic public services in the UK. It
   reviews a number of innovative iDTV initiatives which have sought to
   test the feasibility of using iDTV technology to deliver `interactive'
   electronic services directly to citizens and service users homes,
   thereby potentially making public services more accessible, universally
   available and cheaper to administer. The introduction of these new
   service delivery arrangements, based on the capabilities of new
   information and communication technologies, present a challenge to
   established organizational structures and ways of working. In
   particular, the emergence of iDTV as an electronic service delivery
   channel is forging a new citizens-state relationship, based around the
   transformed role of the television, a medium typically associated with
   entertainment. In this chapter the authors argue, that although the iDTV
   initiatives demonstrate that it is possible do deliver electronic
   services via iDTV, and although there is evidence that citizens are
   interested in using IDTV to access public services, the current
   provision of IDTV is not yet sufficiently advanced to support widespread
   provision and use. Despite this, the rapid take-up of digital television
   and the emergence of iDTV services suggests that iDTV will be an
   important complementary medium for the future delivery of electronic
   government and public services.}},

Abstract = {{This paper first examines technical and legal issues surrounding
   Copyright Management Systems (CMS). It then examines the rationale for
   use of these systems and some accompanying criticisms. It argues that
   there are compelling economic reasons for controlling access to, and use
   of copyrighted material, especially in light of digital technology and
   the Internet. It also argues that CMS have very undesirable qualities
   which raise concerns about social accountability. They can exert strong
   control over access to material, invade privacy and deprive the public
   domain of valuable resources (hence affecting innovation) echoing
   aspects of eighteenth century Blackstonian ideology. The paper concludes
   that the present state of affairs in which CMS has increased the power
   to rights-holders may be detrimental to the development of human
   society. Technology and the law appear to have colluded to potentially
   stifle innovation, hence producing no ultimate winners in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The contemporary idea for interaction has embraced new understandings of
   the content of experience and the structure of space. New electronic
   technologies and advanced digital media have separated realities from
   the realm of the body and transformed experiences into ubiquitous
   events. The architectural discourse, once largely a discourse of form
   and style, has overcome these limitations and encountered, in
   territories of information, the product of a new way of thinking. Marcos
   Novak emerges in this context Of multimedia as an innovative creator
   whose ``liquid architectures{''} represent a break with the traditional
   discourse of physicality. His creations are meant for a virtual domain,
   and information is what structures this new territory for architectural
   practice.
   With respect to Novak's structures, the approaches to virtual spaces
   posited by scholars of new media culture over the past few decades,
   either through phenomenological aspects of the bodily existence and
   modes of experience or through the poststructural metaphoric
   manifestation of codes and symbols, do not suffice. While Novak's work
   does embrace both philosophies, it also transcends them by crossbreeding
   the reality of the individual with the virtuality of the structure.
   Indeed, his architectures require a new concept of space to come
   forward, where the manifestation of the mind in the realm of the body
   calls for what is to be perceived as real. Architecture is now
   characterized by the fusion of information, art, and technology.}},

Abstract = {{In emerging theoretical models of innovation, digital simulation and
   prototyping tools are described as new means of production. However,
   relatively little is known about how such digital tools are used in
   construction and other industrial contexts, in particular how they are
   changing visual practices. In this paper, we present a study of the
   changes associated with interactive 3D technologies between 1990 and
   2005 and we situate the findings in the context of innovation theory.
   With an empirical focus on the construction and film/television
   industries, our study is based both on the analysis of articles in trade
   publications and on interviews with key stakeholders. The dataset
   suggests that aspirations for these technologies are closely linked to
   their role as means of production; however, new practices also develop
   around the technologies as ends. We highlight preliminary implications
   of this study for industry, and give suggestions for further research in
   this area.}},

Abstract = {{The leading IR scene projection (IRSP) device technology, resistive
   emitter arrays, has grown from its early roots in the uncooled
   microbolometer community into a separate and highly specialized field of
   its own. IRSP systems incorporating ``microbolometers running
   backwards{''} are critical tools now ubiquitous in laboratory testing
   and evaluation of high performance IR sensors and their embedded
   algorithms. Adoption of IRSPs has reduced the scope of flight/field
   testing, producing dramatic resource savings and strong system
   development advantages.
   Modern IRSP systems provide the capability to project high-resolution
   (1024 x 1024), high-temperature (750 K) dynamic MWIR-LWIR imagery at
   frame rates up to 200 Hz, with 16-bit input resolution. Novel IRSP
   systems are now being developed to test advanced FPAs and sensors
   requiring wide-format (768 x 1536), cryogenic background (50-80 K),
   fast-framing (400 Hz), and/or very high-temperature (2500 K) dynamic IR
   simulation in order to be properly evaluated.
   The ongoing cycle of sensor improvement and test system evolution is
   perfectly illustrated by the parallel development of IRSP and emerging
   FPA/sensor technologies. The cross-pollination of technology between the
   sensor and projector domains continues to bring innovation to both
   communities. Technological trends related to semiconductor and
   microelectrical-mechanical system (MEMS) device fabrication, real-time
   digital video processing, and EO system design are being exploited by
   both sensor and projector developers alike - with advantages realized by
   both.
   This paper presents a lighthearted overview of the technical evolution
   of IRSP from its early microbolometer roots, discusses current and
   emerging IRSP capabilities, illustrates the device-level to system-level
   synergy between sensors and projectors, and offers a peek into the
   advanced EO simulation capabilities and technologies which will be
   required to address emerging FPA and sensor trends.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations can often be targeted to be more valuable for some consumers
   than others. This is especially true for digital information goods. We
   show that the traditional price system not only results in significant
   deadweight loss, but also provides incorrect incentives to the creators
   of these innovations. In contrast, we propose and analyze a
   profit-maximizing mechanism for bundles of digital goods which is more
   efficient and more accurately provides innovation incentives for
   information goods. Our ``statistical couponing mechanism{''} does not
   rely on the universal excludability of information goods, which creates
   substantial deadweight loss, but instead estimates social value created
   from new goods and innovations by offering coupons to a relatively.
   small sample of representative consumers. We find that the statistical
   couponing mechanism can operate with less than 0.1 percent of the
   deadweight loss of the traditional price-based system, while more
   accurately aligning incentives with social value.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) technology is often overlooked by telecom
   users who are considering advanced battery technologies. Lithium-based
   batteries offer the prospect of higher energy density and better
   performance under adverse environmental conditions, and advances in that
   area generate more ``buzz{''} at conferences. Yet Ni-MH still has a
   story to ten: its energy density is considerably higher than that of
   traditional battery solutions and comparable to other advanced
   technology batteries. Furthermore, the high reliability of this couple
   is not affected by cell-level electronics to control charging and
   discharging.
   The paper details the characteristics of Saft's large-format Ni-MH
   technology and provides comparisons with nickel-cadmium valve-regulated
   lead-acid and lithium-based batteries. It will be seen that Ni-NM offers
   a viable solution for certain niche applications in telecom power. One
   such niche is the emerging application for modular central office (CO)
   power. The paper describes this application and discusses the results of
   trials with a large operating company that is beginning. to develop
   modular CO installations.
   While these large-format Ni-MH batteries are best applied in floating
   applications with controlled temperatures, this does not mean that Ni-MH
   electrochemistry is excluded from outside plant applications. Certain
   legacy digital loop carrier systems with distributed power have long
   been known to overcharge traditional batteries. Based on the space
   savings available with the use of high-temperature cylindrical Ni-MH
   cells, Saft has been able to integrate these cells with an innovative
   charging and control unit all in the same space as existing VRLA
   batteries. This arrangement bypasses the damaging overcharging normally
   imposed by the installed charger, without affecting the attached loads,
   and allows the battery to reach its full life expectancy of over 8 years
   at a continuous operating temperature of 37 degrees C (100 degrees F).
   The last section of this paper describes the components of this battery
   system. The results of field trials and NEBS testing will also be
   discussed.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{24-28}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this article is to summarise the outcomes of
   the one-year Monograph Interlending Project jointly funded by CURL and
   the British Library in 2004-2005.
   Design/methodology/approach - The article presents the main features of
   the BookNow model - a blueprint for a consortial monograph interlending
   service, as developed by the Project, and discusses the issues it has
   brought to the fore.
   Findings - The BookNow model, which was developed with a view to testing
   the viability of the BLDSC-Plus option recommended by the 2003
   consultancy report, Monograph Interlending for the Higher Education
   Research Community, is a radical and innovative customer-focused system
   for the delivery of inter-library loans (ILL) across the UK. However,
   initial business planning indicated a very high cost to both the British
   Library and higher education libraries, were the service to be
   developed. In addition it is unclear whether this level of investment is
   necessary within the context of more recent initiatives which are
   fundamentally transforming the library and information landscape, in
   particular, the Google digitisation programme and the potential for
   developing services based on revealing content through Amazoogle
   strategies. The Project has nevertheless highlighted a number of areas
   where CURL and the British Library could usefully work together and in
   cooperation with other partners within the library and information
   community to improve current ILL practices for the immediate future.
   Originality/value - This is an original piece of research identifying
   ways of improving the delivery of ILL across the UK.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an innovative human-robot communication paradigm for
   people with disability using electromyography (EMG) signals via a
   Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). The paper proposes a novel human-robot
   interaction architecture where the disabled people could interact with
   the robot using an EMG-based Morse code-inspired communication from
   portable devices. The user employs EMG signals to issue high-level
   commands to the robot that decomposes these commands into low-level
   primitive subtasks. Then, the robot dynamically constructs an action
   selection network to form the operational plan. The architecture is
   developed on a PDA that offers small and lightweight mobile interaction
   devices. Utilizing the PDA with EMG-based modified Morse code could
   provide flexibility, mobility, and durability for handicapped people to
   control the robot-aid system. The proposed paradigm has been implemented
   to develop a prototypical system, and the experiments also illustrate
   the conventionality, and the robustness of such a human-robot-framework.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the Internet Non-User (INTU), Internet User (IU) and Online
   Buyer (OB) is important for marketers to enable appropriate target
   marketing, distribution, advertising and customer service. Such
   identification is also critical to public policy makers desirous of
   reducing the digital divide. Despite the criticality of identifying the
   INU, IU and OB, research in marketing on the internet has not focused on
   the associated problem of identifying the determinants of the three
   categories. This research offers a conceptual model, based on innovation
   diffusion theory, for identifying the individuals in each of the three
   categories on the basis of innovativeness, internet use and online
   trust. Demographic variables and availability of home computer are other
   factors used to theoretically predict membership of INU, IU and OB.
   Implications for practice, public policy and research are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{A unique curriculum for lower elementary grades (kindergarten-through
   second grade) has been created using the original ``Ideation
   Conceptualisation{''} model for technology integration created by the
   author, Dr. Shirley Nuss, Media Arts/Computer instructor, and former
   colleague, Kimberly Conely. Dr. Nuss has created the innovative
   curriculum for lower elementary students at Brookside Cranbrook and the
   Vlasic Early Childhood Center, the elementary divisions of Cranbrook
   Educational Community (www.cranbrook.edu), a private college preparatory
   day and boarding school in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Her curriculum
   addresses the need for appropriate technology introduction to lower
   elementary students, which fits seamlessly into the existing classroom
   curriculum and uses computer applications in place of packaged programs
   or integrated technology learning systems. This curriculum is also
   designed to meet the developmental needs and emerging skills of the
   lower elementary student and provides a means of authentic assessment
   shown to adapt easily to media projects. Dr. Nuss developed the
   curriculum after researching the use of technology with young children
   and was able to then adapt it to fit the ``Ideation Conceptualisation
   Model{''} showing the efficacy of the model in designing a technology
   integrated curriculum for the K-2 elementary student as well as grades
   3-5 which was presented in the author's earlier work, ``A Model for
   Collaboration: Integrating Curriculum Technology Into the Elementary
   Media Arts and Studies{''} {[}6]. The curriculum encourages the child to
   engage is such media making activities as creating and publishing a
   classroom book, creating an interactive slide show with Kid Pix, (a
   paint program) and PowerPoint, the use of Claymation and Stop Motion Pro
   to make a simple animation, and using Microsoft's software, PhotoStory3,
   to construct a visual alphabet book using digital images taken by the
   children. Student work will be used throughout the paper to explain how
   the model is used to design projects that will fit into existing
   curriculum and how it might be used to design technology related
   curricula for lower elementary students globally.}},

Abstract = {{Human development has traditionally been associated with factors in the
   economy, health, and education. In recent years, however, access to
   digital technologies has been considered a significant indicator of
   sustainable human development. It appears that an inclusive and active
   information society cannot be accomplished without providing digital
   access to a considerable majority of the society. It is also true that
   development goals of countries can be achieved better when government,
   private, and civil society combine their efforts through innovative
   strategies to establish productive communication regarding the effective
   uses of digital technologies. Improper strategies, on the other hand,
   carry the risk of widening the digital divide between the advantaged and
   disadvantaged groups so that the information gap results in increased
   inequalities between the rich and poor, as well as the high-educated and
   low-educated. Therefore, the overarching policy of contemporary
   societies should be making new technologies work for human development
   and social progress.}},

   existing value chains of the ICT business and industry still endure, the
   innovative value chains are emerging vertically as well as horizontally
   not only within the ICT industry but also between other industries. The
   advances of ICT can create enormous business opportunities. However, in
   Internet-based business and industry, there are still obstacles and
   barriers to overcome. Thereby, Internet-based business enterprises will
   require adoption of the ICT convergence business strategy and/or the

Abstract = {{The bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motor (BPMSM) is an
   innovational type of motor, which has all excellence of magnetic
   bearings. The BPMSM is a high-order, nonlinear and strong coupling
   multivariable system. Bearingless motors have a set of torque windings
   and a set of additional suspension force windings in the stator slots.
   In order to realize the rotor suspending and motor operation steadily,
   decoupling control between the radial forces and torque force is the
   chief precondition. In the paper, based on the basic working principle
   of BPMSM, the mathematics models of the radial forces and rotation part
   on BPMSM are deduced by adopting rotor magnetic field oriented control
   (FOC) strategy. A digital vector control system according to the demand
   of decoupling is designed by using DSP (TMS320LF2407) technique. The
   hardware and the software of the digital control system are developed in
   this paper. The experiment results have shown that the steady suspension
   of the rotor is realized and the speed of the rotor can be continuously
   adjusted within the range of 0 - 5000 r/min.}},

Title = {{Who's using PDAs? Estimates of PDA use by health-care providers: A
   systematic review of surveys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) find many uses in health
   care. Knowing rates of collective PDA use among health care providers is
   an important guiding step to further understanding those health care
   contexts that are most suited to PDA use and whether PDAs provide
   improved health outcomes.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate current and
   future PDA use among health care providers and to discuss possible
   implications of that use on choice of technology in clinical practice
   and research.
   Methods: This study was a systematic review of PDA usage surveys.
   Surveys were identified as part of an ongoing systematic review on the
   use of handheld devices. Reports from eight databases covering both
   biomedical sciences and engineering (1993-2006) were screened against
   distinct eligibility criteria. Data from included surveys were extracted
   and verified in a standardized way and were assessed descriptively.
   Results: We identified 23 relevant surveys, 15 of which were derived
   from peer-reviewed journals. This cohort of surveys was published
   between 2000 and 2005. Overall, since 1999, there is clear evidence of
   an increasing trend in PDA use. The current overall adoption rate for
   individual professional use ranges between 45\% and 85\%, indicating
   high but somewhat variable adoption, primarily among physicians.
   Conclusions: Younger physicians and residents and those working in large
   and hospital-based practices are more likely to use a PDA. The adoption
   rate is now at its highest rate of increase according to a commonly
   accepted diffusion of innovations model. A common problem with the
   evaluation of information technology is that use frequently precedes
   research. This is the case here, in which PDA adoption rates are already
   high and projections are for rapid growth in the short term. In general,
   it appears that professional PDA use in health care settings involves
   more administrative and organizational tasks than those related to
   patient care, perhaps signaling where the growth in adoption is most
   likely to occur. We conclude that physicians are likely accustomed to
   using a PDA, and, therefore, technology expertise will probably not be a
   barrier to implementing PDA applications. However, there is an urgent
   need to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of specific tasks
   using handheld technology to inform those developing and those using PDA
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - In recent years it has been argued that the widespread
   adoption of new information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   presages the ``end{''} of bureaucracy and its replacement by new and
   more flexible organisational forms. The purpose of this paper is to
   question contemporary accounts of ``the network enterprise{''} and ``the
   virtual organisation{''}, arguing that these are founded on a logic
   which abstracts innovation from its institutional and organisational
   context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a case study analysis of
   the British Library to explore the relationship between ICTs and new
   organisational forms.
   Findings - The case study evidence suggests that there is a need to go
   beyond the binary opposition of ``bureaucratic{''} and
   ``post-bureaucratic{''} forms. The evidence also shows that the
   bureaucratic form was associated with the institutional legacies,
   expertise and practices that are crucial in fostering innovation.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that the bureaucratic context offers
   a more propitious environment for innovation than has been suggested by
   managerialist accounts of the ``post-bureaucratic organization{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality systems and Virtual Environments represent innovative
   tools to interact with the digital product model, which call be useful
   in various phases of the product development process. They can support
   ail early and intensive information exchange between marketing, design,
   process planning and manufacturing experts, allowing an easy concurrent
   involvement of heterogeneous competencies and interacting with a single
   virtual product model. However, the fruitful adoption of VR technologies
   implies the rethinking of way of execution of traditional design
   activities in order to structure new processes. But many companies lack
   tools and data to estimate the achievable concrete benefits, considering
   also the counterpart of high investments necessary for VR systems
   implementation. The effective evaluation of VR systems in the CE
   context, ill terms of product quality improvement, of time to market and
   cost reduction is the aim of our research. The present work proposes a
   methodology to measure the VR performances using a metrics-based
   approach. First experimental results related to the method application
   are reported analyzing the conceptual design process and the design
   reviews tasks for the styling product development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss issues associated with
   open access (OA) to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) and to
   describe the University of Waterloo E-thesis Project and its
   partnerships with Theses Canada and the Networked Digital Library of
   Theses and Dissertations.
   Design/methodology/approach - UW E-thesis Project decisions on issues
   associated with electronic submission and CA are presented. Partnerships
   with Theses Canada and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and
   Dissertations are described and the goals and activities of these
   organizations are outlined.
   Findings - Author-created metadata form the UW E-theses searchable
   database of records that link to theses in full text. The metadata are
   OAI compliant and are harvested by Theses Canada and the ETD Union
   Catalog. The E-theses Project supports authors' rights while minimizing
   access restrictions and encourages innovations while respecting the
   value of gradually evolving thesis standards and traditions. The success
   of the UW E-thesis Project illustrates that progress can be made toward
   the OA paradigm for theses and dissertations while upholding perennial
   values. Collaborations with like-minded organizations support and
   advance these goals.
   Originality/value - Academic librarians and graduate studies officers
   will find this e-thesis project description and this discussion of
   issues relevant to planning and maintaining electronic thesis submission
   and access systems at their own universities. The descriptions of the
   benefits of the partnerships may prompt readers to make similar
   connections themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This article was originally the keynote speech to the
   Bielefeld Conference. The article aims to explore the challenges facing
   libraries in the digital age and consider ways in which they need to
   reshape and rethink their services and skills to maintain their
   relevance and contribution.
   Design/methodology/approach - Provides a review of a wide range of
   recently published materials (2003-2006) and gives a broad perspective
   on the challenges facing libraries. These are then considered within the
   case study experience of the British Library to identify key themes for
   redefining the concept of ``library{''}.
   Findings - This article gives a clear articulation of the challenges
   facing libraries. Through the case study the author identifies seven
   themes as central to redefining the library in the twenty-first century:
   know your users and keep close to them; re-think the physical spaces and
   create a desirable draw; integrate marketing into the organisation; open
   up legacy print collections to digital channels and through
   digitisation; reduce legacy costs and continue to improve productivity
   in traditional activities; invest more in innovation and digital
   activities; and develop our people and ensure the right mix of skills.
   Practical implications - A practical source of ideas for those seeking
   to develop their own library activities and a thought-provoking analysis
   for anyone interested in the implications of the digital age.
   Originality/value - This paper gives an original view of changes within
   the library sector from one of the leaders in the field and is rooted in
   the practical and innovative approaches adopted by one of the world's
   great research libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this article is to introduce the digital
   libraries of the future, their enabling technologies and their
   organisational models.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper first discusses the requirements
   for the digital libraries of the future, then presents the DILIGENT
   infrastructure as a technological response to these requirements and,
   finally, it discusses the role that libraries can play in the
   organisational framework envisioned by DILIGENT.
   Findings - Digital libraries of the future will give access to a large
   variety of multimedia and multi-type documents created by integrating
   content from many different heterogeneous sources that range from
   repositories of text, images, and audio-video, to scientific data
   archives, and databases. The digital library will provide a seamless
   environment where the co-operative access, filtering, manipulation,
   generation, and preservation of these documents will be supported as a
   continuous cycle. Users of the library will be both consumers and
   producers of information, either by themselves or in collaborations with
   other users. Policy ensuring mechanisms will guarantee that the
   information produced is visible only to those who have the appropriate
   rights to access it. The realisation of these new digital libraries
   requires both the provision of a new technology and a change in the role
   played by the libraries in the information access-production cycle.
   Practical implications - Digital libraries of the future will be core
   instruments for serving a large class of applications, especially in the
   research field.
   Originality/value - The paper briefly introduces one of the most
   innovative technologies for digital libraries, and it discusses how it
   contributes to the realisation of a novel digital libraries scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this article is to review the trend in academic
   libraries toward including scholarly communication, and by extension,
   electronic publishing, as part of their core mission, using the Cornell
   University Library as an example.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes several manifestations
   of publishing activity organized under the Library's Center for
   Innovative Publishing, including the arXiv (http://arxiv.org/), Project
   Euclid (http://projecteuclid.org), and DPubS (http://DPubS.org).
   Findings - Libraries bring many competencies to the scholarly
   communications process, including expertise in digital initiatives,
   close connections with authors and readers, and a commitment to
   preservation. To add publishing to their responsibilities, they need to
   develop expertise in content acquisition, editorial management, contract
   negotiation, marketing, and subscription management.
   Originality/value - Academic libraries are making formal and informal
   publishing a part of their core activity. A variety of models exist. The
   Cornell University Library has created a framework for supporting
   publishing called the Center for Innovative Publishing, and through it
   supports a successful open access repository (arXiv), a sustainable
   wehhosting service for journals in math and statistics (Project Euclid)
   and a content management tool (DPubS) to enable other institutions
   (libraries, scholarly societies, presses) to engage in similar ventures
   to increase the dissemination of scholarship and to lower the barriers
   to its access.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the
   essential partnerships needed to better guarantee strong added value
   institutional repository (IR) service provision for faculty user
   satisfaction, resulting in the essential content acquisition for IRs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three crucial partnerships are described
   as a basis for the development of a meaningful institutional repository
   set-vice. This paper concentrates on two partnerships: the first
   describes the importance of partnership between institutions; in this
   case, an international subject-specific network: Nereus is an innovative
   consortium of 15 prestigious European universities and institutes in the
   area of economics. The second partnership goes into that of the library
   with its IR content providers and service end users by taking the
   Economists Online (EO) project model as a case in point.
   Findings - University libraries and their changing active roles are
   building valuable partnerships with their clients and information
   providers; the Nereus consortium, and its EO project is a case in point
   where benefits are felt by both libraries and researchers. EO is a
   Nereus cornerstone and aims to increase the usability, accessibility and
   visibility of economics research by digitizing, organizing, archiving
   and disseminating the complete academic output of some of Europe's
   leading economists, with full text access as key. It is building an
   integrated online showcase of Europe based on IRs. EO's prime goal is to
   focus on services of direct value to the author, e.g. providing new full
   text content online, digitizing older material, creating automated
   publication lists, metadata quality-control, more focused dissemination
   of content - all from one repository source and complimentary to the
   services publishers provide. Successful partnerships can be formed by
   designing and offering a strong product and service, combined with a
   good advocacy program containing arguments which support the researcher
   in his/her work process, and addressing real problems.
   Originality/value - Nereus and Economists Online have the potential to
   be a model for adaptation in any disciplinary sector for disseminating
   and giving heightened access to scientific output online. Some of the
   critical success factors of these initiatives have been identified and
   expanded upon in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate knowledge of the directional optical properties of advanced
   fenestration materials is necessary for them to be adequately integrated
   in buildings. These properties are expressed by the Bidirectional
   Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions (BTDF, BRDF) of such
   elements, which are measured by specifically designed measuring
   equipment: an innovative, time-efficient bidirectional goniophotometer,
   based on digital imaging techniques, was designed and set up for that
   purpose. In this paper, the in-depth validation used for the
   bidirectional measurements performed with this apparatus is presented.
   It is based on different approaches including experimental error
   estimation, comparisons to analytical or ray-tracing based models and to
   other measured data, and calculation of the directional-hemispherical
   transmittance (reflectance) gauged against measurements of the same
   systems with Ulbricht (integrating) spheres. The high accuracy and
   reliability of this novel device were confirmed by this detailed
   investigation, and led to a maximum error for BT(R)DF data of only 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulties in accuracy of performed measurements assessment was
   appeared when author analyzed measurement results of joint space width
   on the basis of radiographs. It's followed mainly from accuracy of
   patient position at X-ray unit.
   So that to solve this problem author worked out methods of elimination
   measured data of patients for which variation of measurement results was
   highest (i.e. lowest repeatability of radiographs execution). In this
   way we can perform fewer radiographs for the others patients to decrease
   of mean standard deviation of measured data identified with measuring
   error.
   Author checked practical application of methods outlying observation
   reduction and innovative methods of elimination measured data with
   excess variance at independence as well as dependence of variables.
   Elaborated methods were verified on the basis of measurement results of
   knee-joint width space got from radiographs. Measurements were carried
   out by two methods: directly on the radiographs as well as indirectly on
   the digital images of radiographs.
   Results of examination confirmed legitimacy to using of elaborated
   methodology and measurement procedures. It's solved important problems
   from metrology, which have application in many medical departments,
   especially if it's hard to achieve reduction of random error by increase
   numbers of measurements. Radiology is such a discipline. There is the
   most essential to reduce ionizing radiation dose for patient during
   examinations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper one introduces an innovative attitude propagation system
   for remote sensing satellites based on a series of overlapped images
   taken from a digital camera on the satellite. The system aims to relieve
   the ground control software from the need to identify landmarks in every
   payload image and is not based on expensive and sensitive gyro
   technology. The attitude propagation procedure starts by fitting a space
   correlation model to the first image of the series. Then the
   ``kriging{''} technique is used to predict the next image of the series,
   as a function of its position and attitude small shifts. The attitude
   shift is such that the predicted image matches the next taken image. An
   expression for the theoretical accuracy is presented also. The procedure
   is tested by digital simulation with several realistic Earth's surface
   patterns. Numerical results are presented as a function of the image
   resolution. They give a preliminary idea about the system feasibility
   envisaging its experimental implementation in space.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for real-time and automated monitoring of the condition of
   culverts based on identifying internal defects via video inspection is
   developed. Manual inspection using closed-circuit television has several
   drawbacks, such as inconsistency and subjectivity due to human
   evaluation. Analysis of digital video, consisting of thousands of
   megabytes even at lower resolutions, can be laborious and not suited for
   real-time implementation. An innovative approach is to extract image
   frames judiciously from the video and analyze frames to locate and
   categorize major defects. Rather than analyze all extracted frames, one
   can skip consecutive frames at a minimal loss of accuracy and bring
   considerable saving's in memory and system requirements. Each frame is
   preprocessed to enhance contrast, through use of an adaptive scheme, and
   to reduce dimensionality in pixel-space by implemention of region-based
   processing. Preprocessing is followed by a two-step image segmentation
   process, which implements a background elimination procedure in the
   first step and shape detection in the second step. Fuzzy clustering is
   used as the underlying segmentation model. Defect shape and depth
   information after post-processing are used as input to an assessment
   methodology for automated condition state. A simple formulation based on
   both the damage area and depth is then used to assess the condition of
   culverts based on a four-point condition assessment scale. The proposed
   framework is demonstrated with a test example. Future research would
   entail consolidating the concept by extensive testing and integration
   for real-time application.}},

Abstract = {{The design principles that drove the development of a new cardiovascular
   x-ray digital flat panel (DFP) detector system are presented, followed
   by assessments of imaging and dose performance achieved relative to
   other state of the art FPD systems. The new system (GE Innova 2100(IQ
   (TM))) incorporates a new detector with substantially improved DQE at
   fluoroscopic (73\%@1 mu R) and record (79\%@114uR) doses, an x-ray tube
   with higher continuous fluoro power (3.2kW), a collimator with a wide
   range of copper spectral filtration (up to 0.9mm), and an improved
   automatic x-ray exposure management system. The performance of this new
   system was compared to that of the previous generation GE product
   (Innova 2000) and to state-of-the art cardiac digital x-ray flat panel
   systems from two other major manufacturers. Performance was assessed
   with the industry standard Cardiac X-ray NEMA/SCA\&I phantom, and a new
   moving coronary artery stent (MCAS) phantom, designed to simulate
   cardiac clinical imaging conditions, composed of an anthropomorphic
   chest section with stents moving in a manner simulating normal coronary
   arteries. The NEMA/SCA\&I phantom results showed the Innova 2100(IQ) to
   exceed or equal the Innova 2000 in all of the performance categories,
   while operating at 28\% lower dose on average, and to exceed the other
   DFP systems in most of the performance categories. The MCAS phantom
   tests showed the Innova 2100(IQ) to be significantly better (p << 0.05)
   than the Innova 2000, and significantly better than the other DFP
   systems in most cases at comparable or lower doses, thereby verifying
   excellent performance against design goals.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, We present the design and fabrication of innovative
   phononic crystals integrated with two sets of interdigital (IDT)
   electrodes for frequency band selection of surface acoustic waves (SAW).
   The potential applications of this device include performance
   improvement of SAW micro-sensors, front-end components in RF
   circuitries, and directional receptions of high frequency acoustic
   waves. Analogous to the band-gap generated by photonic crystals, the
   phononic crystals, two dimensional repetitive structures composed of two
   different elastic materials, can prohibit the propagation of elastic
   waves with either specific incident angles or certain bandwidth. In this
   paper, the prohibited bandwidth has been verified by fabricating the
   phononic crystals between a micromachined SAW resonator and a receiver.
   Both the resonator and receiver are composed of IDT electrodes deposited
   and patterned on a thin piezoelectric layer. To confine the prohibited
   bandwidth on the order of hundred MHz, the diameter of the circular
   pores in phononic crystals is designed to be 6 micron and the aspect
   ratio of each pore is 3:1. To maximize the power transduction from IDT
   electrodes to SAW, the spacing between two inter-digits is one-fourth
   the wavelength of SAW. Specifically, the spacing ranges from 3.4 microns
   to 9.0 microns, depending on the central frequency. Both surface and
   bulk micromachining are employed and integrated to fabricate the
   crystals as well as SAW resonator and receiver altogether. Firstly, a
   1.5-micron zinc oxide, which provides well-defined central frequency, is
   sputtered and patterned onto silicon substrate. Second, the IDT
   electrodes are evaporated and patterned by lift-off technique. Then the
   exposed silicon substrate is etched using DRIE to generate two
   dimensional phononic crystals. To tune the prohibited SAW bandwidth, the
   crystal pores are filled-with copper or nickel by electroless plating.
   The insertion loss of the fabricated devices is characterized and is
   found to agree with simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the system architecture and prototype
   measurements of a MEMS gyroscope with a resolution of 0.055
   degrees/s/root Hz. Two innovations are presented. The first is the
   complete migration of control and demodulation tasks to the digital
   domain. For this purpose, interfacing circuits based on Sigma Delta
   techniques are introduced for both primary and secondary mode. The
   advantage is that complex analog electronics for tracking the resonant
   frequency, stabilizing the amplitude of the primary mode oscillation and
   phase-sensitive demodulation can be replaced by their digital
   Counterpart. A second innovation relates to the Sigma Delta
   force-feedback loop. In previously reported structures a compensation
   filter is introduced for stabilizing the loop {[}1-3]. Unfortunately,
   the compensation filter introduces extra poles and influences the
   noise-shaping characteristic, which makes the loop difficult to design
   and optimize. We demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a stable Delta
   Sigma force-feedback loop without an explicit compensation filter.}},

Abstract = {{Analogue and mixed-signal designs are fast becoming significant in
   System-On-Chip (SoC) designs as digital computational cores need to
   interface with the real world. Cellular phones, magnetic disk drives,
   speech recognition hardware and other `digital' innovations in fact rely
   on a core of analogue circuitry. Mature digital CAD tools competently
   handle the digital portions of SoC designs. This is not true for
   analogue and mixed-signals components, still designed manually using
   time-consuming techniques. A good top-down design methodology can
   drastically reduce the design time of analogue components in SoCs and
   allow comprehensive functionality verification. This paper contains a
   critical survey of current design processes and tools, a top-down design
   case study and introduces MIX-SYN, a new platform for fast-tracking

Abstract = {{Telecommunications service providers (telcos) have long dreamed of
   offering the ``Triple Play,{''} i.e., bundled voice, data and video
   services, including high-definition digital broadcast and on-demand
   video services. However, until recently, telcos have been unable to
   offer Triple Play services due to technical obstacles, including
   bandwidth limitations in their access networks and the high cost of
   Triple Play CPE devices.
   Recent deployments have demonstrated that passive optical networks (PON)
   can be cost-effective and can reliably support the transmission of
   high-speed data in excess of 100 Mbps per subscriber, which is
   sufficient to support Triple Play services. Additionally, innovations in
   semiconductor device technology have dramatically decreased the cost of
   Triple Play CPE. With the realization of a robust, flexible broadband
   access network and low-cost CPE that support data, voice and video
   services, what was once a dream is now possible.
   In order to make this dream a reality, PON protocol and voice services
   processor (VSP) system-on-chips (SoC) must be integrated into CPE
   devices that terminate the PON and enable the end-to-end delivery of
   data, voice and video services from the service provider to the
   subscriber's PC or other Internet appliance. These CPE devices, referred
   to as optical services gateways (OSGs), must cost-effectively support a
   wide variety of subscribers and applications, including detached single
   and multi dwelling unit structures.}},

Abstract = {{Telcos today experience a tremendous hazard to their business models:
   Legacy switched voice and carrier-related data-services are being
   threatened by new application and service providers carrying on their
   business ``over the top{''} of the ubiquitous open packet switched
   IP-transport platform, the Internet.
   Till recently, carriers used to be the only ones being able to offer
   telecommunication services like voice, because all services were tightly
   fixed to network structures; even more, transport and service were an
   integral whole and minute-based revenues used to be one stable
   cornerstone of their business.
   With the availability of the ``Esperanto{''}-Internet as the open
   accessible transport platform and with the upcoming of all kinds of
   services on top of that platform, including voice like Skype, carriers
   are once cut back to their undisputed (IP-) access products. So they
   face the challenge, either to somehow rescue in part their minute
   revenues, which often make out more than half of all, or to find new
   revenue sources - or both.
   So, the first alternative is a direct strategy against over-the-top VoIP
   providers ({''}pure play{''}). With an IMS service platform based on an
   NGN-network, a premium voice product, called VoNGN, can be offered. This
   can only save part of the voice business, however. Even more important
   for a future strategy is an enlarged product concept for all-embracing
   communication, presence, and multimedia services. At the end, the former
   carrier is going to have to turn into a broadband network operator (BNO)
   or even better into a digital service provider (DSP) with a
   fully-assorted digital life service portfolio and an outstanding
   customer service (over-the-top providers have nearly no customer
   service) reaching right up to an overall consumer support, including the
   customer's digital environment even at home.
   So, it is key for a solid future for BNOs that they succeed in their
   strategy establishing a survivable next generation business model based
   on this all-inclusive value proposition and thereby sustaining the
   current ARPU at least in a larger part. This way, BNOs are able to match
   up to over-the-top players in their rush to dominate the service market,
   in order to avoid the fate of non innovative carriers being thrown back
   to mere bit pipe providers for access only. The reasons for and the
   vertices of such a new BNO's and DSP's strategy based on an integrated
   NGN and IMS carrier and service provider approach are elaborated in this
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of color is now receiving considerable attention in the
   applications of imaging technology. It is difficult to reproduce the
   original color of subject in conventional imaging systems, and it
   obstructs the applications of visual communication systems in
   telemedicine, electronic commerce, and digital museum. Recently, the
   color videos, still-images, and prints are reproduced with significantly
   better quality than before, but there still remain limitations imposed
   by RGB trichromatic system. To breakthrough the limitation of RGB
   3-primary systems, ``Natural Vision{''} system has been developed aiming
   at an innovative visual communication technology, which enables
   high-fidelity color reproduction, based on spectral information. The
   experimental multispectral systems for both still-image and video have
   been elaborated and shown following features of spectrum-based scheme;
   a) Highly accurate color reproduction is possible with multispectral
   imaging, even under different illumination environment. b) Extended
   color gamut can be reproduced by multiprimary color displays. c) The
   influence of observer metamerism, which is considered as a cause of
   color disagreement between different media, can be reduced by the
   spectral color reproduction. d) The quantitative spectral attributes of
   object, useful for the analysis or the recognition of object, are
   captured and preserved. In addition, the effectiveness of the system has
   been demonstrated through experiments in the application fields, such as
   medicine, digital archives, color printing, electronic commerce, and
   computer graphics.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunities associated with discontinuous change typically do not
   trigger organizational response until the opportunity is perceived as a
   threat. However, threat perception can then trigger a response that
   accentuates organizational rigidity. This cognitive paradox is explored
   using a multilevel, longitudinal case study of a newspaper
   organization's response to digital publishing. The results suggest that
   the competing frames of threat and opportunity can coexist within the
   firm when it creates organizationally differentiated subunits. Such a
   structure minimizes the need to integrate competing frames at the
   subunit level, enabling different behaviors to be enacted simultaneously
   across different units of the firm. This differentiated organizational
   form places an increased burden on senior teams that have to manage the
   inconsistencies across subunits. Insight into the structure of competing
   frames has broader implications for the structure of dynamic
   capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of telecommunication and broadcasting is one of the
   representative innovative technologies in digital environment. It has
   recently been empathized as an alternative solution to overcome already
   saturated telecommunication and broadcasting markets. However, the
   growth of related service and market cannot reach prior expectation due
   to the lack of understanding on the real users.
   Telecommunication technologies support users' instrumental purpose and
   broadcasting services usually serve their entertainment activities,
   which have an inherent value. Our research question is which factors
   influence users' attitude and decision making in the use of convergence
   services in the area of telecommunication and broadcasting. To access
   the determinants, we propose hedonic and utilitarian values as intrinsic
   and extrinsic motivators, and perceived control as internal and external
   conditions.
   To verify our model empirically, we have selected the DMB technology, a
   good example for the distinctive convergence service of
   telecommunication and broadcasting. In order for the DMB service to
   differentiate itself from the existing media and create unique benefits
   as a business model, service providers must develop individually
   customized contents based on each user's context information and life
   style and deliver them with the format meeting their hedonic needs and
   demands.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Addresses the rapid expansion of computer connectivity and the
   opportunities provided for criminals to exploit security vulnerabilities
   in the online environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - International efforts to combat
   cyber-crime are reviewed by evaluating the forms of mutual legal
   assistance (MLA) now in place.
   Findings - Cyber-crime is often traditional crime (e.g. fraud, identify
   theft, child pornography) albeit executed swiftly and to vast numbers of
   potential victims, as well as unauthorised access, damage and
   interference to computer systems. Most detrimental are malicious and
   exploit codes that interrupt computer operations on a global scale and
   along with other cyber-crimes threaten e-commerce. The cross-national
   nature of most computer-related crimes have rendered many time-honoured
   methods of policing both domestically and in cross-border situations
   ineffective even in advanced nations, while the ``digital divide{''}
   provides ``safe havens{''} for cyber-criminals. In response to the
   threat of cyber-crime there is an urgent need to reform methods of MLA
   and to develop trans-national policing capability.
   Practical implications - The international response is briefly outlined
   in the context of the United Nations (UN) Transnational Organised Crime
   Convention (in force from September 2003) and the Council of Europe's
   innovative Cyber-crime Convention (in force from July 2004). In
   addition, the role of the UN, Interpol, other institutions and
   bi-lateral, regional and other efforts aimed a creating a seamless web
   of enforcement against cyber-criminals are described.
   Originality/value - The potential for potent global enforcement
   mechanisms are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present research deals with the digital synthesis of the multiview
   diffractive image elements, or simply the Multiview Diffractive Images
   (MDIs), also known as stereographic diffractive images or holographic
   stereograms. These images are designed to be included in Diffractive
   Optically Variable Image Devices (DOVIDs) in order to make them more
   spectacular and visually impressive and to improve their security
   properties.
   In the present paper there are considered the computation of parameters
   for Diffractive Gratings (DGs) composing the MDI topology. The
   innovative DGs based on the curvilinear strokes are offered. They
   provide larger diffraction efficiency and better integrity of the scene
   for any variant of the Lighting and Observation (LO) as well as for the
   arbitrary parameters of LO geometry. There are described the original
   approach for computation and estimation of the polychromatic DGs
   intended to reproduce the complex spectral distribution of the
   diffracted light.
   There are proposed the powerful and flexible techniques for Diffractive
   Images (DIs) encoding and for uniting different DIs within multichannel
   one. The distinctions in the modes of the MDI observation, which were
   escaping anyone's attention until now, are discussed. The physical
   aspects of visual perception for diffractive images are also concerned.
   So, the present investigations elucidate the main topics pertinent to
   the diffractive images synthesis and approach to master the creation of
   striking ones, particularly the multiview images.}},

   around the world, drawing valuable experiences from Osborne and
   Gaebler's ten principles of ``reinventing government{''} for china to
   learn. Then reviews the practices of China's government innovations
   since it adopted policies of market-oriented economic reform and open-up
   to outside world, identifies the difference from:those of full-blown
   market system. Thereby, analyzes special problems exist in China present
   society which impede the process of building a harmonious society.
   Finally the paper highlights important government innovations needed for
   a harmonious society, these are: responsible and responsive, effective
   and efficient, open and transparent, as well as digital and professional

Abstract = {{This contribution will discuss engineering design projects with various
   environmental and sustainable objectives. The automotive industry is
   facing a major vicissitude regarding the system layouts of their
   products. Given the rapidly increasing demands for environmentally
   acceptable and sustainable vehicles, developed even faster and under
   increasing competition, one could expect a future, or a period of
   transition where a ``market pull{''}-situation will exact design methods
   more adapted for new propulsion technologies such as fuel-cells,
   bio-fuels, hybrid configurations and so forth. When looking at
   two-wheeled vehicles it's also a matter of a dramatic change in the
   safety requirements that would affect the design process in a similar
   way. This paper presents studies made regarding development of
   two-wheeled vehicles with strict safety, environmental and
   sustainability requirements. It also describes what happens when a very
   mature product, such as a conventional motorcycle undergoes dramatic
   changes with propulsion system and safety features and becomes
   technically immature, but still has to preserve its traditional values
   in the eyes of the consumer. During the last two years, the Department
   of Mechanical Engineering at Linkoping University has conducted
   different projects dealing with these issues using rapid, low cost,
   demonstrator development, together with digital models. The demonstrator
   is used as a vehicle to evaluate the integration of technology, as well
   as less tangible aspects such as ergonomics, drivability, appeal, visual
   impression etc. This approach has proven particularly fruitful when
   dealing with new technologies with a high level of innovation. The rapid
   nature of these projects also makes them suitable for exploring digital
   collaboration tools aimed for controlling and speeding up the design
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices such as PDAs and Tablet PCs have gained popularity in
   introducing new pedagogical approaches and active learning experiences.
   The current tools that support note taking severely limit in coalescing
   the abstract notes with the underlying copious information and hence are
   demoted in being an efficient study tool. We propose an intelligible
   system that efficiently addresses the inherent subjectivity in student
   perception of note taking and information retrieval. We employ an
   innovative idea of cross indexing the digital ink notes with matching
   electronic documents in the document repository. We perform
   intra-document indexing along with document indexing which handles
   polysemy efficiently. We define intra document indexing as indexing
   pages in each document based on its relevance to the query. We tested
   our methods on 5 full courses with approximately 12 lectures per course.
   A detailed usability analysis on the system was done with a total of 25
   students. The results from the above exploratory studies reveal that the
   proposed system indeed provide highly enhanced student learning
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Digital retail payments have evolved during the last years mostly due to
   technology innovations. New actors enter the payments market, increase
   competition and threaten banks' dominance. Consumers' behavior is
   critical within this context, since they are the ones that will finally
   adopt or reject a payment innovation. In this paper we propose a model
   of consumer behavior towards payment system selection based on
   multi-agent simulation. It is based on a multi-agent platform that
   models consumers as intelligent agents and formats their behavior
   according to rules extracted from past payments data, experts' knowledge
   and marketing research. Contributions from social science and network
   economics also refine the agent's behavior in order to simulate
   accurately the domain. This paper presents the overall model and an
   initial analysis of payments domain, defining major actors in the domain
   and their interpretation to agents.}},

Abstract = {{The Galileo Joint Undertaking 2nd Call, in the frame of the Research and
   Development activities related to the Galileo Programme, provides the
   ground to support research institutes and SME's on key technological
   development. In this context, DEIMOS Engenharia and the Institut de
   Geomatica are conducting the IADIRA study for improvements and further
   possibilities on hybridisation techniques.
   Previous Galileo Phases studies, such as Galilei, already identified the
   possibilities to integrate the future Galileo system with other systems
   and sensors, which might lead to a significant enhancement of its
   performance. It is well known that use of GNSS will be heavily dependent
   on sensor hybridisation, accurate digital maps and Local Elements.
   The innovative IADIRA project focuses in the field of inertial aiding,
   referring to the use of inertial-derived position and velocity for the
   improvement of the GNSS receiver tracking loops, and inertial coasting,
   which refers to the use of inertial-derived position and velocity to
   interpolate GNSS trajectories for short periods, be it because of GNSS
   data gaps or just to interpolate between GNSS fixes.
   The main study objective is to explore the inertial aiding of the future
   Galileo or Galileo/GPS receivers as this aspect of the future Galileo
   technology has not yet been explored. More specifically, we present
   results of how MEMS Miniature Inertial Measurement Units can be seamless
   and transparently integrated into GNSS receiver antennas through an
   tightly coupled or deeply integrated architecture.
   To analyse and demonstrate the concept a test-bench is developed and the
   receiver is prototyped in a sample-based (bit-true) Galileo software
   receiver based on GRANADA receiver {[}1] coupled to the combined
   GNSS-Inertial software. Real or simulated IMU data provides the required
   inertial sensor measurements. Reference trajectories are obtained using
   navigation grade IMU and used to generate receiver Doppler profiles,
   providing a truth reference to measure the performance increase when
   using inertial aiding of IADIRA concept.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor and dense urban positioning has received much attention in the
   last years, since they constitute the bottleneck in the extension of
   location services in mobile networks. Global Navigation Satellite System
   (GNSS) positioning has turned out to be a very suitable candidate to
   enable this kind of services. This has motivated in recent years an
   increasing research activity on signal processing techniques for indoor
   GNSS receivers.
   The main limitations faced by indoor GNSS receivers are due to the
   complex propagation of the GNSS signals in indoor sites. These
   limitations have given rise to the so-called High Sensitivity GNSS
   Receiver architecture. This kind of receivers process long periods of
   signal. By means of long non-coherent integration, they can achieve low
   sensitivity, and avoid the effects of bit transitions and clock drifts.
   The purpose of this paper is the presentation and evaluation of an
   indoor GPS positioning receiver by using real-life data. The live data
   used in the paper will come from the digitalization of the GPS signal
   collected at several indoor sites. The receiver is an Assisted-GPS one
   that has been implemented in software and works in snapshot mode. It
   includes both the signal processing able to estimate the pseudoranges
   and the proper positioning computation. Special emphasis is put on the
   newly developed way of extending the coherent correlation interval up to
   20 ms without being affected by the bit transitions in the navigation
   message. This coherent correlation is followed by non-coherent
   integration in order to achieve the low sensitivity required indoors.
   The implementation of the coherent correlation is done in a very
   efficient way by intensive use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and
   its properties. The advantages of the new acquisition algorithm with
   regard to previous ones not doing data wipe-off will be stated in the
   paper. Furthermore, the paper addresses the advantages of the 20-ms
   coherent correlation in order to solve the pseudorange ambiguity,
   typical in Assisted-GPS, and the impact on the computation of the
   position.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the GPSIIR-M and the experimental Galileo satellites (GIOVE-A)
   were launched making the first step in the orbit-validation of the GPS
   modernization system and of the Galileo system. The new signals
   generated by the GPSIIR-M satellite and the Galileo system require
   modulations which are more complex than the QPSK modulation used in the
   current GPS system. These new modulations could be a source of
   distortions for the received signal and require analyses and
   optimisation.
   Indeed, in the Galileo system, the Alternate Binary Offset Carrier
   modulation (ALTBOC) is an innovative modulation proposed for the
   transmission of the E5 band signal and the Composite Binary Coded Symbol
   (CBCS) is an innovative signal proposed to optimize the L1 Open service
   (OS) signal. All the Galileo signals have a constant envelope
   modulation, thereby allowing the use of saturated power amplifiers with
   limited signal distortion. However the signals have 8 phase
   ``scattered{''} plots in the modulation diagram and a deviation of the
   modulation plots, with respect to the nominal constellation, could
   reduce the performance of the tracking loops in the receiver. This
   deviation of modulation plots constellation could be induced by the
   Amplitude-Modulation to Phase-Modulation (AM/PM) distortions of the
   amplifier in the payload. But it could also be resulting from the phase
   noise created by the instabilities of the payload and receiver clocks.
   The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the phase noise due
   to the SSPA (Solid State Power Amplifier) and to the payload and
   receiver clocks instabilities, on the receiver tracking performance. The
   case of the Galileo E5 signal will be studied considering a classical
   payload scheme.
   The transmission scheme can be described as follows. In the payload
   unit, the signals are first digitally generated, then converted by a
   digital-to-analog device, up-converted, and then amplified by the SSPA
   before being transmitted in their respective frequency bands. In the
   receiver part, the signals are down-converted, then go through the
   analog-to-digital converter, and are finally tracked by the Phase Lock
   Loop and the Delay Lock Loop. The evaluation of the performance in
   reception is based on the phase error estimated in the Phase Lock Loop.
   In a first part the way the phase noise affects the signals through the
   payload assuming a typical performance of the on-board clock generation
   unit is studied. In this part the phase noise introduced by the SSPA is
   also investigated and compared to the phase noise introduced by the
   atomic clock instabilities. Then, the power spectral density of the
   phase noise due to the receiver clock and its effects on the received
   signal during the down-conversion and the analog-to-digital conversion
   are presented. The effect of the incoming signal phase noise on the
   phase estimation in the Phase Lock Loop is also studied. Finally, to
   conclude, the impact of the SSPA phase noise and payload/receiver clocks
   phase noise on the receiver performance are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, e-learning has become an established medium for
   delivering distance learning courses. Early systems merely allowed
   students to access course material, but as their popularity grew these
   systems were augmented to provide features for tutors to monitor
   students' progress and deal with many administrative tasks. While these
   web-based learning systems have much to offer both students and
   teachers, many of them lack two key components of conventional classroom
   based teaching, namely motivation for students and collaboration.
   Collaborative Learning Environments (CLEs) are a new kind of e-learning
   solution which have emerged to address these issues. CLEs are multi-user
   web-based Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs), which allow
   students to interact with each other. Many now provide a simulated 3D
   environment in which users are immersed. This paper describes CLEV-R
   (Collaborative Learning Environment with Virtual Reality), an innovative
   and new type of CLE. In particular, we discuss some of the technical
   issues which were addressed during development and provide a concrete
   example of a user session. As the prevalence of mobile learning
   increases, this paper also describes efforts in creating a mobile CLE,
   allowing students to collaborate while on the move using their Personal
   Digital Assistants (PDA).}},

   a new DTV standard which would employ the most recent technologies. One
   of the proposals for the new standard's physical layer was named
   Innovative Modulation for the Brazilian Digital TV System (MI-SBTVD).
   This proposal employs OFDM and has an operation mode where space-time
   diversity at the transmitter may be employed, requiring at the receiver
   side a channel estimation algorithm capable of identifying the MIMO
   channel. This paper presents some algorithms where the estimation at
   pilot subcarriers is obtained through a linear combination of two
   received symbols, and interpolation is done to provide channel gains at
   data carriers. As the proposed system has the pilot subcarriers
   positioned in such manner to allow bi-dimensional interpolation, four
   possible algorithms are evaluated through computer simulations. The
   results for digital TV channel models are compared.}},

   innovative project, which intends to create a framework, which allows
   through a fast data modeling-implementing interface elements that

   relationship network among heterogeneous items. This environment also
   allows the machine to do operations over these relations, such as to
   find paths or sets, to help the implementation of AI algorithms, or data
   extraction by the final user. Through graph theory, with visual items,
   it is possible to find elements with specific characteristics and
   relationships between them, by the application of filters, refining
   searches inside an extreme large datasets, or showing differentiated
   connection maps. Two prototypes were created with this framework: A
   system which allows seeing telephonic calls sets and financial
   transactions, and a system for ontology viewing for a digital dictionary
   inside a semantic network. Another software, in prototypical phase, also
   for semantic network vision, is being constructed. This document will

Abstract = {{The display and interpretation of images obtained by combining
   three-dimensional data acquired with two different modalities (eg,
   positron emission tomography and computed tomography) in the same
   subject require complex software tools that allow the user to adjust the
   image parameters. With the current fast imaging systems, it is possible
   to acquire dynamic images of the beating heart, which add a fourth
   dimension of visual information - the temporal dimension. Moreover,
   images acquired at different points during the transit of a contrast
   agent or during different functional phases add a fifth dimension
   functional data. To facilitate real-time image navigation in the
   resultant large multidimensional image data sets, the authors developed
   a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine - compliant software
   program. The open-source software, called OsiriX, allows the user to
   navigate through multidimensional image series while adjusting the
   blending of images from different modalities, image contrast and
   intensity, and the rate of cine display of dynamic images. The software
   is available for free download at

Abstract = {{The number, and size, of digital video databases is continuously
   growing. Unfortunately, most, if not all, of the video content in these
   databases is stored without any sort of indexing or analysis and without
   any associated metadata. If any of the videos do have metadata, then it
   is usually the result of some manual annotation process rather than any
   automatic indexing. Locating clips and browsing content is difficult,
   time consuming and generally inefficient. The task of managing a set of
   movies is particularly difficult given their innovative creation process
   and the individual style of directors. This paper proposes a method of
   searching video data in order to retrieve semantic events thereby
   facilitating management of video databases. An interface is created
   which allows users to perform searching using the proposed method. In
   order to assess the searching method, this interface is used to conduct
   a set of experiments in which users are timed completing a set of tasks
   using both the searching method and an alternate, keyframe based,
   retrieval method. These experiments evaluate the searching method, and
   demonstrate it's versatility.}},

Abstract = {{Digital close-range photogrammetry system and machine vision are widely

   provide accurate 3D objects or reconstruction of an object surface and

   camera calibration and target image: positioning for 3D object surface
   vision measurement were briefly reviewed and analyzed in this paper.
   Then, an innovative and effect method for precise space coordinates
   measurements was proposed. Test research proved that the thought and
   methods we proposed about image segmentation, detection and positioning
   of circular marks were effective and valid. A propriety weight value for
   adding parameters, control points and orientation elements in bundle
   adjustment with self-calibration are advantageous to gaining high
   accuracy of space coordinates. The RMS error of check points is less
   than 1 mm, which can meet the requirement in industrial measurement with
   high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the displacement of flexible bridges directly is difficult
   particularly on monumental suspension bridges. Since these bridges cross
   over sea channels or large rivers, installation of conventional devices
   for displacement measurement is technically not easy and costly, if not
   impossible. In this study, real-time displacement measurement of bridges
   was carried out by means of digital image processing techniques. This is
   innovative, highly cost-effective and easy to implement, and yet
   maintains the advantages of dynamic measurement and high resolution.
   First, the measurement point is marked on the bridge with a target panel
   of known geometry. A commercially available digital video camcorder is
   installed on a fixed point some distance from the bridge (e.g. on the
   coast) or on a pier (abutment) of the bridge which can be regarded as a
   fixed point. The camcorder with a telescopic device installed takes a
   motion picture of the target marked. Meanwhile, the displacement of the
   target is calculated using an image processing technique, which requires
   a target recognition algorithm, projection of the captured image, and
   calculation of the actual displacement using target geometry and the
   number of pixels moved. To measure the displacement at multiple
   locations on the bridge, an effective synchronized vision-based system
   was developed using master/slave system and wireless data communication.
   For the purpose of verification, the measured displacement by
   synchronized vision-based system was compared with the data measured by
   a contact-type sensor, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)
   from laboratory tests. The displacement measured by the proposed method
   showed a good agreement with the data from the conventional sensors. A
   field test on a pedestrian suspension bridge was also carried out to
   check the feasibility of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative software architecture of the Wireless Distributed
   Measurement System (W-DMS) including the web-enabled Measurement
   Application Repository Server (MARS) is proposed. The duties of the MARS
   are devoted to permit the connectivity by the various wireless
   communication protocols, such as GPRS/UMTS, WiFi and Bluetooth, and to
   supply the mobile devices, as Personal Digital Assistant and smartphone,
   with the measurement application in order to manage and control the
   measurement instruments. The proposed architecture shares in increasing
   the adaptability and the flexibility characteristics of the W-DMS to the
   new requirements of the industrial applications. The aspects concerning
   the design and the architecture of the MARS are discussed. In order to
   evidence the innovative features, the applicative example is shown.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative digital holography system suitable for shape and
   deformation comparisons between master and sample objects with rough
   surfaces is described. The innovative aspect of comparative digital
   holography is the illumination of the sample by the conjugated wavefront
   of the master, as a type of coherent mask, using a liquid crystal
   display (LCD). The resulting interferogram indicates directly the shape
   or the deformation differences between the master and sample. As it is
   not necessary that both objects to be compared are located at the same
   place for this technique, remote shape or deformation comparison between
   a master and a sample is possible. A current research topic is the
   precise alignment of the sample and the reconstructed master wavefront
   so that the resulting phase map only contains information of the
   differences in shape or deformation. The reconstructed master wavefront
   can be adjusted digitally to correctly illuminate the sample object, by
   introducing an artificial phase-shift. This phase-shift is induced by
   the LCD, and offers also the possibility of calibrating precisely the
   set-up. The value for the phase-shift is obtained by a comparison of the
   resulting interferogram with a database containing fringes from
   simulations of misalignments between master and sample objects. Using
   the iterative algorithm described here, the correction of the sample
   position can be controlled by an automatic adaptation of the coherent
   mask.}},

Abstract = {{A heterogeneous community of practice spans many disciplines, industries
   and professions. Members of these communities are united by common
   research, products and experiences but are frequently separated by
   specialized vocabulary and industry terms. This lack of language
   commonality presents a challenge to efficiently locating relevant Web
   based information which usually depends on the user's knowledge of the
   field and ability to select suitable terms to formulate a search query.
   Research and practice have shown that the quality of information
   retrieval is significantly improved when taxonomy is employed to
   organize terms that describe the search domain. This paper presents an
   innovative, collaborative approach to building taxonomy for a particular
   domain, populating it with Web content and sharing it among members of
   the community of practice. A model is built and results and implications
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{More and more precise parts are being required in modem domains of
   scientific research and manufacturing industry, which urges the
   corresponding measuring technologies to ameliorate and innovate,

   introduction about the optics interferometry and digital image
   processing technology respectively. Then, a 3D reconstruction method
   based on interferometry and image processing is described in the paper
   to solve surface measuring problem of a kind of planar part. The method
   can show the microcosmic surface of the part distinctly. At the same
   time, some parameters of the part can be calculated to reflect the
   manufacturing quality. According to these parameters, the conclusion on
   whether the part is qualified or not can be made, some another
   conclusion on how to modify the part for better result can also be
   determined. At last, some experiments have been done to verify the
   effect of the method. The method is simple, convenient and practical.
   Its measurement capability is between atomic force microscope and

Abstract = {{The paper presents an innovative approach totally based on digital data
   to optimize lower limb socket prosthesis design, This approach is based
   on a stump's detailed geometric model and provides a substitute to
   plaster cast obtained through the traditional manual methodology with a
   physical model, realized with Rapid Prototyping technologies; this
   physical model will be used for the socket lamination. The paper
   discusses a methodology to reconstruct a 3D geometric model of the stump
   able to describe with high accuracy and detail the complete structure
   subdivided into bones, soft tissues, muscular masses and dermis. Some
   different technologies are used for stump acquisition: non contact laser
   technique for external geometry., CT and MRI imaging technologies for
   the internal structure, the first one dedicated to bones geometrical
   model, the last for soft tissues and muscles. We discuss problems
   related to 3D geometric reconstruction: the patient and stump
   positioning for the different acquisitions, markers' definition on the
   stump to identify landmarks, alignment's strategies for the different
   digital models, in order to define a protocol procedure with a requested
   accuracy for socket's realization. Some case-studies illustrate the
   methodology and the results obtained.}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement of information technology, video logging has become
   a feasible and common practice for state-level departments of
   transportation (DOTs) to visualize roadway conditions to support various
   transportation activities. A new and innovative image-processing
   algorithm and method using video log images to enhance the highway
   roadway geometry data collection is presented. The algorithm is based on
   Canny edge detection, slope-adaptive edge reduction, a novel recursive
   approximation of the vanishing point, localized color thresholding, and
   knowledge-based Hough transform. Experiments on real digital images
   indicate that the algorithm is feasible for automated road geometric
   data collection, especially in recognizing lane marks and shoulder
   edges. The algorithm was implemented with Visual C++ language and tested
   on a Pentium IV 3.06-GHz computer. It indicates that the average
   processing speed is about 280 ms for an image size of 1,300 X 1,050. The
   developed method can be used by state DOTs to save money and cost by
   flagging the video images with a variation index. Thus, the video images
   with a high variation index (e.g., changing lane location) can be
   identified for a focused visual measurement. Future studies for
   evaluating the algorithm under various weather, lighting, and roadway
   conditions are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have invented and are developing a new Real-Time
   Stereoscopic Catadioptric Onmi-Detection (RSCO) system based on a
   high-resolution stereoscopic vision system, an acoustic array with
   high-fidelity/sensitivity, real-time image processing hardware based on
   evolutionary stream processors (SPs) with unprecedented digital signal
   processing (DSP) performance, and proprietary unwrapping and operating
   software. The RSCO development involves optimizing (1) the
   onmidirectional multimodal (visible/MWIR) sensor system configuration
   and mechanical hardening to survive harsh conditions and to minimize
   maintenance; (2) a video/image processing hardware architecture based on
   the ultrahigh-performance SPs, (3) an acoustic array with
   high-performance DSP technology; and (4) real-time unwrapping and
   operating software. SPs form a new class of image processors scalable to
   teraOPS, with efficiency comparable to ASICs, and completely
   programmable in high-level languages. SPs innovatively combine a new
   programming model, tool automation, and hardware to exploit the high
   data parallelism and processing locality that are inherent in a wide
   range of applications, especially media processing. The excellent
   performance, efficiency, and programmability of SPs make them ideal for
   implementation of the RSCO system, with its unprecedented
   onmidirectional, multiple-modality sensors, range, accuracy, size, and

Abstract = {{The recent emergence of integrated PicoRadio technology, the rise of low
   power, low cost, System-On-Chip (SOC) CMOS imagers, coupled with the
   fast evolution of networking protocols and digital signal processing
   (DSP), created a unique opportunity to achieve the goal of deploying
   large-scale, low cost, intelligent, ultra-low power distributed wireless
   sensor networks for the visualization of the environment. Of all
   sensors, vision is the most desired, but its applications in distributed
   sensor networks have been elusive so far. Not any more. The practicality
   and viability of ultra-low power vision networking has been proven and
   its applications are countless, from security, and chemical analysis to
   industrial monitoring, asset tracking and visual recognition, vision
   networking represents a truly disruptive technology applicable to many
   industries.
   The presentation discusses some of the critical components and
   technologies necessary to make these networks and products affordable
   and ubiquitous-specifically PicoRadios, CMOS imagers, imaging DSP,
   networking and overall wireless sensor network (WSN) system concepts.
   The paradigm shift, from large, centralized and expensive sensor
   platforms, to small, low cost, distributed, sensor networks, is possible
   due to the emergence and convergence of a few innovative technologies.
   Avaak has developed a vision network that is aided by other sensors such
   as motion, acoustic and magnetic, and plans to deploy it for use in
   military and commercial applications.
   In comparison to other sensors, imagers produce large data files that
   require pre-processing and a certain level of compression before these
   are transmitted to a network server, in order to minimize the load on
   the network. Some of the most innovative chemical detectors currently in
   development are based on sensors that change color or pattern in the
   presence of the desired analytes. These changes are easily recorded and
   analyzed by a CMOS imager and an on-board DSP processor. Image
   processing at the sensor node level may also be required for
   applications in security, asset management and process control. Due to
   the data bandwidth requirements posed on the network by video sensors,
   new networking protocols or video extensions to existing standards (e.g.
   Zigbee) are required. To this end, Avaak has designed and implemented an
   ultra-low power networking protocol designed to carry large volumes of
   data through the network.
   The low power wireless sensor nodes that will be discussed include a
   chemical sensor integrated with a CMOS digital camera, a controller, a
   DSP processor and a radio communication transceiver, which enables
   relaying of an alarm or image message, to a central station. In addition
   to the communications, identification is very desirable; hence location
   awareness will be later incorporated to the system in the form of
   Time-Of-Arrival triangulation, via wide band signaling. While the
   wireless imaging kernel already exists specific applications for
   surveillance and chemical detection are under development by Avaak, as
   part of a co-founded program from ONR and DARPA. Avaak is also designing
   vision networks for commercial applications-some of which are undergoing
   initial field tests.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical processing of celluloid based cinematic film, becomes unstable
   with time, unless they are stored at low temperatures. Some defects,
   such as bleaching on color movies, are difficult to solve using
   photochemical restoration methods. In these cases, a digital restoration
   tool can be a very convenient solution. Unfortunately, for old movies
   color and dynamic range digital restoration is usually dependent on the
   skill of trained technicians who are able to control the parameters
   through color adjustment, and may be different for a sequence or group
   of frames. This leads to a long and frustrating restoration process. As
   an alternative solution, we present in this paper, an innovative
   technique based on a model of human color perception:, to correct color
   and dynamic range with no need of user supervision and with a very
   limited number of parameters. The method is combined with a technique
   that is able to split the movie into different shots and to select
   representative frames (key frames) from each shot. By default, key
   frames are used to set the color correction method parameters that are
   then applied to the whole shot. Due to the robustness of the color
   correction method the setting used for the key frame is used
   successfully for all the frames of the same shot.}},

Abstract = {{The digital revolution and the new way of thinking in the 21(st) century
   (as a result of the rapid evolution of technology) inevitably affect the
   music industry. Innovative kinds of e-business, which are virtual and
   evolve dynamically in a digital environment, tend to prevail the
   traditional retail stores. The traditional models should be revised, and
   new business models should be created, in order the electronic business
   to succeed. Information technologies (IT) would have the main role in
   the new business models, while new features will reconstruct the
   processes and the relations that constitute the music industry value
   chain. The new face of music e-commerce requires new strategies and new
   B2C and B2B models. Such a model is the advertisement model (ad-based
   model). Advertisements could be used as an alternative way of making
   profits, instead of selling music, since Internet users are yet quite
   familiar with free music downloading. The core idea of the proposed
   model of the paper is the distribution of free music with embedded sound
   advertisement spots of sponsors over the Internet. Certain improvements

Abstract = {{A new type of simulation training system for power system operation is
   presented in this paper. It is based on transmission mimic board, double
   screen PC, mimic control panel, and real-time digital simulator, KEPS.
   The operating simulation includes the simulations of the control panel
   interface and the simulator. The mimic board displays transmission
   network summary information using a software view of the hardware based
   mimic board. The symbols, numbers and colors layout exactly match those
   of the KEPS draft case to provide operators a familiar and effective
   starting point. This paper describes the development of an innovative
   training system, utilizing the benefits of 3 dimension visualization s/w
   and communication-control s/w to create the appropriate operational
   environment and allow simulation of various power system operations
   without the restrictions of other training methods. Experiences gained
   in developing concepts and meeting considerable s/w challenges are
   outlined, and the potential of the simulator for future operations
   training discussed.}},

Abstract = {{H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is the latest video-coding standard jointly developed
   by VCEG (Video Coding Experts Group of ITU-T and MPEG (Moving Picture
   Experts Group) of ISO/IEC. It uses state of the art video signals
   algorithms providing enhanced efficiency, compared with previous
   standards, for a wide range of applications including video telephony,
   video conferencing, video surveillance, storage, streaming video,
   digital video editing and creation, digital cinema and others.
   In order to reduce the bitrate of the video signal in H.264, the ISO and
   ITU coding standards use a 1/4 pel displacement resolution. A 6-tap,
   Wiener filter is utilized to obtain half-pel samples, which are then
   averaged in order to achieve the quarter-pel interpolation.
   In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm for the reduction of
   the interpolation complexity. The goal is to adapt the H.264 1/4 pel
   interpolation to the complexity of the video stream to encode, on the
   basis of our motion detection algorithm.
   In the proposed solution, the reduction of interpolation complexity
   decreases the overall encoder complexity both in low and high complex
   sequences. This paper illustrates the behavior of the H.264 encoder with
   our motion detection algorithm for dynamic interpolation purpose. The
   obtained results are then compared with jm86 standard interpolation
   using different quantization values.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation argues that the visual and literary work of the
   poet-painter David Jones (1895-1974), together with the ``painted
   inscriptions{''} he pioneered, are reminiscent of ancient manuscripts,
   while simultaneously anticipating postmodern hypertexts.
   Jones's ``painted inscriptions{''} are the apotheosis of the unity of
   the two disciplines he practised: painting and poetry. His inscriptions
   consist of painted poetic texts, often quotations, composed of his own
   unique lettering where each alphabetical form is designed to accommodate
   its neighbours. The style of the letter forms evokes the language(s) of
   the poetic texts, and the layout contributes to the meaning.
   As a child gifted in drawing, Jones's familial environment also
   encouraged his interest in the written word. By 1927, he was an adept
   illustrator, and he pictured himself as a medieval monk in a
   scriptorium. This quasi self-portrait precedes his determination to
   ``make a shape in words,{''} with illustrations, based on his
   experiences as a foot soldier during the Great War. Just two
   illustrations accompany this epic poem, but in 1952 he realized his
   ambition with the publication of his next long poem, The Anathemata. His
   illustrations expand on and illuminate the text, ranging as they do from
   sophisticated wood- and copper-engravings through highly complex
   figurative paintings in mixed media to his abstract painted
   inscriptions. As such, the illustrations reflect the verbal expression
   in a number of ways. The pattern of the poetry on the page, the use of
   varied fonts: capitals, italics, and the use of different languages
   together with allusions to literary and biblical texts, are of utmost
   significance to the meaning. Had Jones not died before the digital age,
   which he would most certainly have embraced owing to the combinations
   and manipulations afforded by this technology, it is likely that he
   would have employed hypertext, and perhaps would have extended its
   boundaries by including text as image, and vice versa.
   In addition, his poetry and visual art are shot through with references,
   resonances and connotations of other literary and visual artists' works
   and genres, as well as his personal experiences. Accordingly, Jones
   might be accused of eclecticism and even pastiche. Both are symptomatic
   of the postmodern condition. However, this discussion demonstrates that
   Jones's approach to the visual, verbal and the synergetic combination of
   the two, place him in the canon of poets and visual artists whose works
   are informative, innovative and original, being rooted in tradition but
   having prescient overtones.}},

Abstract = {{Concepts on the uses of digital media emphasise their potential to
   support problem-oriented, self defined and cooperative teaching and
   learning. It remains unclear, whether teachers really exploit this
   potential. It is possible that the new media are simply integrated into
   traditional teaching practice. The objective of the research project,
   reported on here, is to contribute to the development of a theory on
   teaching practice in the new media context. The project (1) identified
   behavioral patterns of teachers using new media in their lessons and (2)
   generated hypothesis on possible links between behavioral patterns,
   expertise in the use of media and subject-disciplines. Video recordings
   of twenty lessons were analyzed using a low-inference category system
   and on the basis of recognizable patterns evaluated using cluster
   analysis. The results show that between the poles ``instructional{''}
   and ``constructivist{''} different patterns of teacher behavior for
   implementation of digital media in lessons can be identified, which can
   be described as traditional teacher-centred and innovative
   pupil-oriented, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of modern, efficient technology has far-reaching
   consequences for the geography of economic activity, inequality, and
   environmental quality. This article examines two popular yet highly
   controversial claims about the conditions most favorable to the rapid
   spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer advantage
   allows developing countries to diffuse new technology faster than
   developed countries. The second claim, widely articulated by advocates
   of neoliberal policy reform, is that new technologies diffuse more
   rapidly where countries are ``open{''} to international trade and
   investment. To investigate these claims we use event-history analysis to
   estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of
   developed and developing countries for three very different
   technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, shuttleless textile
   weaving looms, and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly
   support both propositions. Countries that adopt new technology later or
   have a smaller existing capital stock-characteristic features of
   developing countries-diffuse new technology more rapidly than countries
   that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity-two characteristics
   of developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the
   rate of diffusion positively for all three technologies. Yet, consistent
   with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that
   foreign direct investment (FDI) accelerates the diffusion of new
   technology in host economies. The article concludes by discussing the
   geographical implications of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Regional electronic marketplaces (REMs) have been used to promote
   e-commerce uptake by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, the
   community and regional economic development motives underpinning REM
   creation can cause complexities. While REM development and management
   can be informed by existing theoretical frameworks, there is no
   comprehensive framework that can be used to examine the factors
   affecting the success or failure of government-supported SME-REMs. The
   objective of this paper is to construct such a framework that can be
   used to examine these factors. The literature on e-marketplaces and
   IT/IS/e-commerce adoption by SMEs is examined to determine the
   appropriateness of existing theoretical frameworks, the key constructs
   of which are synthesised to form an integrated theoretical framework.
   The value of the framework is confirmed by content analysis of published
   case studies and empirical results from in-depth case studies of two
   SME-REMs. The most significant factors affecting success or failure of
   government-supported SME-REMs are as follows: SME-owner innovativeness;
   REM ownership structure and governance that engender trust and build
   critical mass by including SMEs in REM development and management;
   matching REM focus and structure with regional profile by leveraging
   community ties and existing business relationships; adopting a staged
   approach to REM development; and ensuring REM benefits are understood by
   SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{The trend in data acquisition systems for modern physics experiments is
   to digitize analog signals closer and closer to the detector. The
   digitization systems have followed the progress of commercial analog to
   digital converters. The state of the art for these devices is currently
   225 MSample/s for a 10 to 12 bit range. The new boards, described in
   this paper, have been designed to improve these performances by an order
   of magnitude. In its simplest version, this board mainly includes 4
   channels sampling analog data up to 2 GSample/s with an analog bandwidth
   of 300 MHz, and digitizing it with a 12-bit dynamic range. It is based
   on the custom-designed MATACQ chip. The latter's innovative design
   permits reaching these performances with power consumption smaller than
   1 W. The boards are triggerable either by internal or external signals
   and several boards are easily synchronizable. The board integrates both
   GPIB and VME interfaces that permit a maximum readout speed of 500
   events/s with the whole memory depth of the 4 channels read.}},

Abstract = {{Clementine was a technology demonstration mission jointly sponsored by
   the Department of Defense (DOD) and NASA that was launched on January
   25th, 1994. Its principal objective was to use the Moon, a near-Earth
   asteroid, and the spacecraft's Interstage Adapter as targets to
   demonstrate lightweight sensor performance and several innovative
   spacecraft systems and technologies. The design, development, and
   operation of the Clementine spacecraft and ground system was performed
   by the Naval Research Laboratory. For over two months Clementine mapped
   the Moon, producing the first multispectral global digital map of the
   Moon, the first global topographic map, and contributing several other
   important scientific discoveries, including the possibility of ice at
   the lunar South Pole. New experiments or schedule modifications were
   made with minimal constraints, maximizing science return, thus creating
   a new paradigm for mission operations. Clementine was the first mission
   known to conduct an in-flight autonomous operations experiment. After
   leaving the Moon. Clementine suffered an onboard failure that caused
   cancellation of the asteroid rendezvous. Despite this setback, NASA and
   the DOD applied the lessons learned from the Clementine mission to later
   missions. Clementine set the standard against which new small spacecraft
   missions are commonly measured. More than any other mission, Clementine
   has the most influence (scientifically, technically, and operationally)
   on the lunar missions being planned for the next decade.}},

Abstract = {{Use of resistant cultivares is one of the major tactics for combating
   soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, which is the most
   destructive pathogen affecting soybean seed production. However,
   developing new H. glycines-resistant soybean cultivars is a very
   labor-intensive process, partially due to the lack of a quick method for
   counting the H. glycines females that develop on soybean roots. We have
   developed a fluorescence image-based system for counting females on
   excised seedling roots cultured on nutrient media in petri dishes. In
   this system, the females fluoresced when exposed to a wavelenght of 570
   nm. The fluorescent images were captured with a digital camera,
   transfered to a computer, and displayed on a monitor. The image of an
   entire sample was viewed at once, and the fluorescing females were
   counted manually. This system significantly improved the efficiency and
   accuracy of counting females developed on cultured seedling roots
   compared to a microscope counting method. The potential for applications
   in the screening of nematode-resistant crops is discussed.}},

   language arts courses. Data for the study were obtained using
   qualitative research methods, including in-class observation (field
   notes), videotaping, interviews, and collection of documents. Discussion
   of the issue of appropriation is framed in relation to sociocultural

   Cambridge: Cambridge University Press] to demonstrate how by this point
   enacting the writing process in an ICT-rich environment had become a
   highly self-regulated, routine cultural practice. Further evidence of
   appropriation is provided by the fact that, by Grade 10, students had
   begun on their own to transfer the use of the writing process to the
   completion of assignments in other school subjects, thus suggesting that
   this cultural tool had come to be valued as a means of helping them
   achieve the personal goal of producing a better written product and not
   merely fulfill a course requirement. The teacher's proleptic stance in
   terms of the way he viewed this developmental process is also discussed.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses how the Open Innovation concept, as recently coined
   by Henry Chesbrough, can be analyzed from an industrial dynamics
   perspective. The main proposition of the paper is that the specific
   modes in which different companies manage Open Innovation in regard to
   an emerging technology reflect their differential position within the
   innovation system in question, the nature and stage of maturity of the
   technological regime, and the particular value proposition pursued by
   companies. The proposition is analyzed through an in-depth study of the
   cut-rent transformation of sound amplification from linear solid state
   technology to switched or digital technology within the consumer
   electronics system of innovation. The analysis especially addresses the
   complex interplay between technology entrepreneurs and incumbents, and
   demonstrates that Open Innovation sometimes has to be conducted under
   conditions of high transaction costs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Keywords chronicle and capture cultural change by creating common
   categories of meaning against diverse local usages. We call this the
   global-local tension. To test competing theories of this tension, we
   employ frame analysis of more than 500 journal abstracts over a 25-year
   period, tracking the spread of business model as an economic keyword
   generated during unsettled economic times. Analyses reveal the
   simultaneous adoption of ``global{''} and ``local{''}frames without one
   supplanting or co-opting the other. The global-local tension is
   conciliated by providing primacy across communities of discourse to a
   small collection of frames (i.e., the global presence) while maintaining
   a plurality of local use within communities (i.e., the local
   alternative).}},

Abstract = {{Recent discoveries in earth sciences are mostly related to technologies
   allowing graphical representations of volumes. We present a way to
   produce mathematically and geometrically correct three-dimensional (3-D)
   geologic maps consisting of the volume and shape of all geologic
   features of a given area. The method is innovative in that it only uses
   surface information based on the combination of a standard geologic map,
   a satellite image, and a digital elevation model. It is based on a
   modeling algorithm that only, uses surfaces calculated from scattered
   data points and that intersects them following a series of geologically
   sound rules. The major advantage of using such technology is that it
   provides the user with a way to quantify geology. To illustrate how a
   3-D geologic map can be computed, we explain the steps taken to build a
   dummy model with simple faulting and depositional sequencing. The case
   study chosen to illustrate the method is the Beirut watershed (Lebanon),
   an area with relatively simple geology. The 3-D visualization and cross
   sections help in the understanding of the geometrical relationship
   between the different geologic features, allowing a reexamination of the
   tectonic history of the area during the late Mesozoic.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical knowledge is expanding at an unprecedented rate-one that is
   unlikely to slow anytime in the future. While the volume and scope of
   this new knowledge poses significant organizational challenges, it
   creates tremendous opportunities to release and direct its power to the
   service of significant goals. The authors explain how the Center for
   Knowledge Management at The Ohio State University Medical Center,
   created during the academic year 2003-04, is doing just that by
   integrating numerous resource-intensive, technology-based
   initiatives-including personnel, services and infrastructure, digital
   repositories, data sets, mobile computing devices, high-tech patient
   simulators, computerized testing, and interactive multimedia-in a way
   that enables the center to provide information tailored to the needs of
   students, faculty and staff on the medical center campus and its
   surrounding health sciences colleges.
   The authors discuss how discovering, applying, and sharing new
   knowledge, information assets, and technologies in this way is a
   collaborative process. This process creates open-ended opportunities for
   innovation and a roadmap for working toward seamless integration,
   synergy, and substantial enhancement of the academic medical center's
   research, educational, and clinical mission areas.}},

   evidence and trust in an autonomic communications and computing
   environment. A combination of security, privacy enhancing technologies,
   trustworthy computing interfaces and techniques, advocacy, and greater
   understanding of the socio-economic and technical aspects of this new
   electronic phenomena must be covered to establish a sound e-business
   operating environment on a global level. Some possible solutions
   pertaining to this environment are also reviewed and examples of some
   key research areas outlined. Finally a brief overview of directions for

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the investigation of an innovative low-cost
   receiver design for incoherent binary DPSK-systems. Due to device
   tolerances, the generated carrier frequencies of distant clients, i.e.
   communication transceivers, have always a slight difference which is
   known as frequency offset. At present several analog methods for the
   elimination of such frequency offsets are available, which require the
   implementation of a carrier recovery circuit, i.e. in form of a
   Costas-Loop or a Squaring-Loop. Besides these coherent receiver
   concepts, incoherent systems need expensive analog-to-digital converters
   to track the rotation of the points in the constellation. The introduced
   receiver, however, uses neither a carrier recovery circuit nor expensive
   analog-to-digital converters. This new concept is realized by a finite
   state machine (FSM) forming a baseband channel selection (BCS) control,
   which will be established in this paper. Finally, simulations prove the
   high quality of such incoherent DBPSK transceivers compared to coherent
   systems, using fully digital implemented low-cost hardware for decoding.}},

   DRAM. Yet, in IC design, due to limitation of linked list memory
   management and IC area, the implement of linear allocation will be more
   complex. In this paper, a novel bitmap approach is proposed for free
   memory management. With efficient search architecture, compression
   algorithm and pre-fetch buffer, the work complexity of bitmap approach
   can be reduced considerably, linear allocation can be implemented easily
   and memory management can also be optimized to provide high

Abstract = {{Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) has been widely advocated as a new
   device architecture for nanotechnology. Using QCA, the innovative design
   of digital systems can be achieved by exploiting the so-called
   capability of processing-in-wire, i.e., signal manipulation proceeds at
   the same time as propagation. QCA systems require low power together
   with the potential for high density and regularity. These features make
   QCA an attractive technology for manufacturing memories in which the
   in-wire paradigm can be exploited for storage purposes. This paper
   proposes a novel parallel memory architecture for QCA implementation.
   This architecture is based on storing information on a QCA line by
   changing the direction of signal flow among three clocking zones. Timing
   of these zones requires two additional clocks to implement a four-step
   process for reading/writing data to the memory. Its operation has been
   verified by simulation. It is shown that the requirements for clocking,
   number of zones, as well as the underlying CMOS circuitry are
   significantly reduced compared with previous QCA parallel architectures.}},

Abstract = {{High technology products such as notebook computers and digital cameras
   have short life cycles due to global competition and rapid technological
   advances. As newer products, replete with latest technologies, become
   available, the demand for older products erodes. To renew the
   competitiveness of a product, the manufacturer may upgrade its features
   over time. Since products comprise a set of features with several
   alternatives for each, design involves complicated decisions: which
   features to upgrade, what alternatives should be chosen, and when to
   upgrade. This paper proposes a model to prescribe profitable upgrades of
   individual features in a family of products. The model integrates
   decisions traditionally made by various organizations in the enterprise
   (marketing, product design engineering, process design engineering,
   production planning and supply chain management). The special structures
   embedded in the model are identified and decomposition principles are
   applied to solve large-scale instances of the size and scope encountered
   in industry. Tests establish computational benchmarks, showing that this
   decomposition approach outperforms a commercial solver, most
   dramatically on more challenging instances. The solution obtained by
   solving the model will aid managers in deciding the content and timing
   of upgrades to maximize life cycle profit.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of prescribed burning on forage abundance and suitability
   for elk (Cervus elaphus) during the snow-free season was evaluated in
   east-central Banff National Park, Canada. Six coniferous forest and
   mixed shrub-herb plant communities (n = 144 plots), and 5223 ha of
   burned (n = 13 1) vegetation < 12 years old were sampled using a
   stratified semi-random design. Sampling units represented various
   combinations of vegetation, terrain conditions, and stand ages that were
   derived from digital biophysical data, with plant communities the basic
   unit of analysis. Burning coniferous forest stands reduced woody
   biomass. and increased herbaceous forage from 146 to 790 kg/ha.
   Increases commonly occurred in the percent cover of hairy wild rye
   (Leymus innovatus (Beal) Pigler) and fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium
   (L.) Holub.). The herbaceous components of mixed shrub-herb communities
   increased from 336747 kg/ha to 517-1104 kg/ha in response to burning (P
   < 0.025, Mann-Whitney U-test). Browse biomass (mostly Salix spp. and
   Betula nana L.) increased >= 220\% (P <= 0.003, Mann-Whitney U-test)
   from 653 kg/ha in deciduous shrub types. Elk preferences for unburned
   and burned vegetation-types were assessed as low and moderate,
   respectively. Potential summer carrying capacity, based on forage
   availability, increased from eight to 28 elk/100 km(2) within burned
   areas, whereas spring grazing potential rose from 13 to 45 elk/100
   km(2). Most of the increase (73\%) was attributable to changes within
   burned Engelmann Spruce stands, which composed 58\% of the burned area.

Abstract = {{A novel methodology combining digital imaging, conventional fixed
   visibility monitors, and solar radiation monitors has been developed to
   characterize the visual air quality of the El Paso and Ciudad Juarez
   urban vista. The authors have found that the digital image quality is
   reproducible and useful for quantitative analysis of visibility
   conditions. Regions of interest were selected in images along view paths
   of interest and values for a contrast variable of interest, typically
   the coefficient of variation or contrast ratio (CR) for discrete
   targets, were computed. Both of these indices are bounded at 0 and 1 and
   are scaled to the ``clean day{''} maxima for a given date, time, and
   selected view paths. This produces a relative visibility index for
   various view paths. With the siting of a Belfort (6230A) visibility
   monitor at a central location, it has been possible to initiate contrast
   analysis of various targets in current and archived camera images
   obtained near this monitor. For uniformly ``clean{''} days, as indicated
   by fine particulate matter observations and visual inspection, the
   authors have been able to use the extinction coefficient (B-ext) derived
   from the 6230A to put the relative visibility index, based on CR, on an
   absolute basis in terms of an ideal target located at a given distance.
   This permits the generation of contrast extinction, B-ext/C, for each
   view path that is independent of the actual target intrinsic contrast
   (within limits) and allows the comparison of B-ext/C, along different
   view paths with other air quality indices. Multiple linear regression
   was used to derive a relationship between the CR-based B-ext/C, value
   and air quality parameters. Visibility attenuation because of sulfate
   particles was found to have the highest correlation with B-ext/C. In
   addition, solar radiation was observed to be a significant predictor of
   visibility in the urban region.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males. Men aged 50
   years and older are recommended to undergo an annual digital rectal
   examination (DRE) and determination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   in serum for early detection. Fortunately, disease-specific mortality
   continues to decline as a result of advances in screening, staging, and
   patient awareness. However, about 30\% of men with a clinically
   organ-confined disease show evidence of extracapsular extension or
   seminal vesicle invasion on pathological analysis. Consequently, there
   is a need for more accurate diagnostic tools for planning tailored
   treatment.
   A variety of modern imaging techniques has been implemented in an
   attempt to obtain more precise staging, thereby allowing for more
   detailed counseling, and instituting optimum therapy. This review
   highlights developments in prostate cancer imaging that may improve
   staging and treatment planning for prostate cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an innovative approach to map microphytobenthos
   biomass and fractional cover in Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast)
   using Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral data.
   Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its
   spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than
   that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a ``mixed
   pixel{''} problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low
   tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The
   resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral
   endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of
   classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance
   spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the
   effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes
   that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance
   spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and
   spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from
   laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with
   different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional
   cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance
   spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to
   combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover. This new
   approach, when compared to more classically used ones such as indices,
   linear unmixing or spectral distance analysis, is proven to enable a
   much more reliable determination of biomass despite the large variety of
   substrates found in Bourgneuf Bay. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Single energy X-ray imaging, due to its low cost and flexibility, is one
   of the most used and common technique to assess bone state and bone
   remodeling over time. Standardized X-ray images are needed to compare
   sets of radiographs for semi-quantitative analyses of tissue remodeling.
   However, useful mathematical modeling for the analysis of high level
   radiographic images are not easily available. In order to propose a
   useful evaluation tool to a wide clinical scenario, we present an
   innovative calibration algorithm for a semi-quantitative analysis of
   non-standardized digitized X-ray images. For calibration on a unique
   standardization scale, three time invariant regions (ROI) of radiographs
   were selected and analyzed. The accuracy of the normalization method for
   X-ray films was successfully validated by using an aluminum step wedge
   for routine X-ray exposures as tool to standardize serial radiographs
   (Pearson correlation test: R-2=0.96). This method was applied to
   investigate the progression of the new bone deposition within ceramic
   scaffolds used as osteoconductive substitute in large bone defects
   taking advantage of a large animal model. This innovative
   image-processing algorithm allowed the identification and
   semi-quantification of the bone matrix deposited within the implant. The
   osteo-integration at the bone-implant interface was also investigated. A
   progressively increasing bone tissue deposition within the porous
   bioceramic implant and a progressive osteo-integration was observed
   during the 12 months of the trial. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{I work to unbundle the structure of inertia into two distinct
   categories: resource rigidity (failure to change resource investment
   patterns) and routine rigidity (failure to change organizational
   processes that use those resources). Given discontinuous change, a
   researcher's failure to recognize these distinctions can generate
   conflicting findings regarding effects of threat perception on inertia.
   Using field data on the response of newspaper organizations to the rise
   of digital media, I show that a strong perception of threat helps
   overcome resource rigidity but simultaneously amplifies routine
   rigidity. I develop an interpretive model exploring mechanisms for
   overcoming these divergent behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Innovative thinking and experimentation were the hallmarks
   of Mack Fulwyler's approach to research. This report summarizes some of
   the ideas and their early realizations that he pursued in the field of
   imaging cytometry, work that was not published before his untimely
   death, although he composed the initial draft of this report.
   Methods: Included are related experiments implemented in the
   programmable array microscope (PAM) devised for patterned illumination
   and detection, the instrument that Mack Fulwyler employed during a
   sabbatical leave in Gottingen in 1998. Despite being the originator of
   instrumentation for flow cytometry and Sorting, Mack Fulwyler was
   intensely interested in imaging systems, recognizing their ability to
   resolve cellular details obscured by the whole cell signals generally
   acquired in flow. At one point, these interests merged with those of two
   other authors (I.T.Y. and T.M.J.), leading to the Image Cytometry and
   Sorting (ICAS) strategy and project. A major goal was uncomplicated rare
   cell detection and isolation using a sequential process of cellular
   labeling via suitable probes, whole field imaging, and selective
   area-restricted photoinduced reactions designed to encapsulate and/or
   chemically or physically tag cells in a manner permitting subsequent
   fractionation by bulk techniques.
   Results and Conclusion: This publication features photoinduced
   polymerization, photodecaging, photoactivation, and photochromic
   conversion reactions carried out by Fulwyler and/or the other authors
   with the PAM, employing operator designated patterns and locations in
   various samples. Photopolymerization of polyethylene glycol-diacrylate
   to a gel-like structure allowing the specific selection of objects
   (cells) for further analysis and processing techniques was the approach
   explored personally by Mack Fulwyler in relation to the WAS concept. (c)

Title = {{Linking riparian dynamics and groundwater: An ecohydrologic approach to
   modeling groundwater and riparian vegetation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{551-564}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The growing use of global freshwater supplies is increasing the need for
   improved modeling of the linkage between groundwater and riparian
   vegetation. Traditional groundwater models such as MODFLOW have been
   used to predict changes in regional groundwater levels, and thus
   riparian vegetation potential attributable to anthropogenic water use.
   This article describes an approach that improves on these modeling
   techniques through several innovations. First, evapotranspiration from
   riparian/wetland systems is modeled in a manner that more realistically
   reflects plant ecophysiology and vegetation complexity. In the authors'
   model programs (RIP-ET and PRE-RIP-ET), the single, monotonically
   increasing evapotranspiration flux curve in traditional groundwater
   models is replaced with a set of ecophysiologically based curves, one
   for each plant functional group present. For each group, the curve
   simulates transpiration declines that occur both as water levels decline
   below rooting depths and as waters rise to levels that produce anoxic
   soil conditions. Accuracy is further improved by more effective spatial
   handling of vegetation distribution, which allows modeling of surface
   elevation and depth to water for multiple vegetation types within each
   large model cell. The use of RIP-ET in groundwater models can improve
   the accuracy of basin scale estimates of riparian evapotranspiration
   rates, riparian vegetation water requirements, and water budgets. Two
   case studies are used to demonstrate that RIP-ET produces significantly
   different evapotranspiration estimates than the traditional method. When
   combined with vegetation mapping and a supporting program (RIP-GIS),
   RIP-ET also enables predictions of riparian vegetation response to water
   use and development scenarios. The RIP-GIS program links the head
   distribution from MODFLOW with surface digital elevation models,
   producing moderate- to high-resolution depth-to-groundwater maps.
   Together with information on plant rooting depths, these can be used to
   predict vegetation response to water allocation decisions. The different
   evapotranspiration outcomes produced by traditional and RIP-ET
   approaches affect resulting interpretations of hydro-vegetation
   dynamics, including the effects of groundwater pumping stress on
   existing habitats, and thus affect subsequent policy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to link and compare diverse archaeological data sets will
   catalyze innovative research of great scope and analytic rigor. However,
   information heterogeneity and limited budgets and information technology
   skills challenge data dissemination initiatives. This paper argues for
   new methods of community-based data integration pioneered by the
   University of Chicago's Extensible Markup Language (XML) System for
   Textual and Archaeological Research project (XSTAR). With XSTAR, data
   integration takes place in two steps: (1) syntactic-schematic
   integration: Legacy data sets are migrated for representation in the
   data structures described by the Archaeological Markup Language
   (ArchaeoML), and (2) Semantic integration: Mappings must be established
   between related terms and classes in each source database. Because the
   nuances of meaning are often very subtle, human experts must classify
   related items in each data set. Initial syntactic-schematic mapping of
   data into XSTAR is simple and fast but occurs at a relatively abstract
   level of meaning. Nevertheless, this initial step can accommodate
   diverse archaeological (and other) data sets, and will facilitate
   community-led development of more semantically specific data
   integration. XSTAR hopes to enable multiple semantic data integration
   schemas to develop and keep pace with changing research agendas. though
   rooted in archaeology, this paper discusses challenges faced by many
   disciplines in encouraging more powerful diachronic and regional
   syntheses. ArchaeoML's highly generalized data model has applicability
   outside archaeology, especially with subdisciplines of the earth
   sciences yet to develop formal ontologies. In addition, because this is
   a community driven approach, incentives for community participation must
   be explored. Intellectual property and professional rewards are key
   factors in determining the success of online dissemination systems
   across many disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{A new domain of application of monolithic active pixel sensors, with
   respect to particle tracking, has been triggered by the innovative idea
   of a nondestructive beam monitoring system in the extraction lines of a
   hadron-theraphy center. The beam monitoring exploits secondary electrons
   emitted from a submicrometer thick Al foil, intersecting the beam.
   Electrons are accelerated in an electrostatic field. The detection of
   low-energy electrons, up to 30 keV, is required. The sensitivity to
   these energies is obtained by thinning the detector, originally
   fabricated in a standard VLSI technology, down to the thickness of the
   radiation sensitive layer. A thin entrance window, in the order of 100
   nm, is provided. Monolithic active pixel sensors for low-energy electron
   imaging can be prospectively used in several domains: in bioscience for
   cell process study using radiotracers, e.g., H-3(18 keV beta(-)) or
   fluorescence imaging exploiting the Hybrid Photodiodes principle, in
   safety or environmental studies for neutron imaging with converters
   directly deposited or in micro-beam facilities for position resolving in
   studies of living cell irradiations. The low-energy electron imaging
   capabilities for installation inside an HPD test facility and the
   results obtained with a H-3 marked source are shown. The detector used
   is the 1 x 10(6) pixel MIMOSA V chip. The back-thinning up to the
   epitaxial layer was applied, resulting in a high resolution, back-side
   illuminated imager.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel real-time digital signal
   processing technique for power quality disturbance detection. The
   proposed technique is inspired on the Divide and Conquer Principle and
   on the Innovation Concept. Essentially, the Divide and Conquer Principle
   is applied in splitting the monitored disturbance event into stationary
   and nonstationary components, allowing localized individual signal
   analysis. Thereafter, the Innovation Concept is introduced for revealing
   new information not previously observed in the energy of the
   nonstationary signals and so detecting a new event. In addition, this
   paper demonstrates a straightforward and feasible way to evaluate the
   Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) or a distortion measure for voltage
   signals. Simulation results indicate that the proposed technique is able
   to accurately detect a variety of voltage disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Copyright duration has been or is being extended in many countries.
   Technological and demographical changes were cited by a US Senate report
   to argue for US copyright term extension. This paper analyzes the
   validity of the arguments. Simulation of a model of the information
   product market indicates that a decrease in copying cost of information
   products due to digital technologies calls for a reduction of copyright
   duration. Partial support is found for the argument that longer life
   expectancy and delayed child-bearing may support copyright term
   extension. Furthermore, an increase in demand for information products
   is found to call for reduction in copyright duration. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Title = {{Seven years of clinical experience with teleconsultation in
   craniomaxillofacial surgery}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In this work the experiences from 50 telemedically supported
   treatments in craniomaxillofacial surgery are summarized and different
   setups for their technical realization are described. Furthermore, for
   the first time the innovative UMTS (universal mobile telecommunication
   system) is applied for the transmission of arthroscopic videos of the
   temporomandibular joint and other craniomaxillofacial structures.
   Materials and Methods: The combination of computer-assisted navigation
   technology in augmented reality environments with telecommunication is
   used for execution of interactive stereotaxic teleconsultation.
   Furthermore, treatments without navigation are telemedically supported.
   This stud), is composed of 4 technical system configurations: 1)
   integrated services digital network (ISDN)-based videoconferencing
   without remote control of the navigation computer; 2) transmission
   control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)-based interactive
   teleconsultation via bundled ISDN lines (including remote control of the
   navigation computer); 3) TCP/IP-based interactive teleconsultation Via
   network; 4) combination of TCP/IP-connection and ISDN-based
   videoconferencing. The telemedically supported treatments are:
   orbitozygomatic osteotomies, positioning of the mandibular condyle in
   orthognathic surgery, insertion of implants, positioning of the maxilla
   in orthognathic surgery, distraction osteogenesis, arthroscopies of the
   temporomandibular joint, and operation simulations on stereolithographic
   models. The surgical interventions are evaluated on a 5-level system
   performance scale from the technical point of view. In a separate trial
   20 videosequences of arthroscopies of the temporomandibular joint are
   transmitted via UMTS cellular phones and independently evaluated by 3
   experts (ie, a total of 60 streamings) to investigate feasibility of
   this technology in the field of craniomaxillofacial surgery.
   Results: In the years from 1996 to 2002 a total of 50 treatments were
   telemedically supported. All intraoperative applications were
   successfully finished; 48 of 60 UMTS transmissions were finished without
   any interruptions in constant quality, slight interruptions were
   observed in 8 tests, and a complete breakdown was observed during 4
   streamings that required a restart of the transmission. Resolution was
   sufficient to diagnose even tiny anatomic structures inside the
   temporomandibular joint, but orientation was hardly recognizable.
   Conclusion: in many applications telecommunication technology can
   contribute to a quality improvement in cranio- and maxillofacial surgery
   because of the global availability of specialized knowledge. The
   required technical expenditure for teleconsultation crucially depends on
   the infrastructure that is already available at the clinic and the
   remote site. UMTS is a promising technology with the potential to be
   valuable in numerous craniomaxillofacial applications. (c) 2005 American

Abstract = {{The activities surrounding the National Digital Library Program (NDLP)
   at the Library of Congress (1995-2000) are used to study nstitutional
   processes associated with technological innovation in the library
   context. The study identified modalities of successful innovation and
   the characteristics of creative decision making. Theories of social
   change and organizational rationality and the social construction of
   technology (SCOT) approaches provided the theoretical basis for this
   study. The underlying design for a phenomenological approach is
   discussed, together with the method for constructing a descriptive
   narrative that synthesizes the phenomenon under study (an emergent
   national digital library program). Theory, methodology, data collection,
   and the summary of findings, with implications for practice, are
   presented here. The accompanying article, Part II (available as an
   electronic-only article in this issue), presents qualitative data and
   the application of the interpretive phenomenological framework,
   documenting the variability of the innovators' perspectives about this

Title = {{Resuscitating the teaching of anatomical pathology in undergraduate

Abstract = {{Aims: Medical education has undergone substantial change in recent
   years, resulting in shorter, more compact courses that often contain
   much less pathology than previously. There has also been a concurrent
   decrease in the academic pathologist workforce in Australia, such that
   medical schools struggle to deliver even this reduced pathology
   curriculum. This paper reports the development and evaluation of an
   innovative approach in an undergraduate medical school to supporting
   pathology lectures, through integrating pathology with clinical
   medicine.
   Methods: A series of 32 clinical pathological cases (CPCs) was developed
   to replicate clinicopathological conferences in a small group format.
   The CPCs were based on the pathology lectures, developed by a
   multidisciplinary clinical team and delivered to the students by
   clinical tutors. Students had access to learning support resources on
   the School's Intranet in both the main campus and rural teaching sites.
   Digitised pathology images, Web-based delivery and semi-guided learning
   issues are the main characteristics of the pathology module. The module
   was evaluated by a ranking system by the medical students for two
   consecutive years.
   Results: In both years, the CPC module achieved a high score when
   compared with other components of the pathology curriculum. Positive
   feedback and frequent enquires were also received about the module.
   Conclusion: The Web-based CPC modules provide an important resource that
   can facilitate teaching of pathology to medical students in the main
   campus and rural teaching sites. The module provides an opportunity to
   improve the profile of pathology in the medical school, in a manner that
   is sustainable with only one academic pathologist. It has the potential
   to be used nationally and internationally because of its
   multidisciplinary nature and the flexibility in its mode of delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Media delivery over heterogeneous networks requires both flexible
   representation and robust protection of content. This paper provides
   details on the framework for audiovisual content creation, delivery,
   consumption and protection as conceived within the IST project The
   Innovative Rights and Access Management Interplatform SolUtion. The
   proposed framework is based on the emerging MPEG-21 standard for
   multimedia content delivery and consumption and at the same time it
   complements it in several aspects, most notably by fully specifying a
   digital rights management (DRM) scheme. Central to the described
   framework is a novel key management system, relying on smartcards, which
   addresses many issues that previously blocked wider adoption of DRM:
   obtrusiveness of the DRM technology perceived by the end-User,
   flexibility in licence formulation and adequate level of trust as
   requested by content owners. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic and interventional flat detector X-ray systems are
   penetrating the market in all application segments. First introduced in
   radiography and mammography, they have conquered cardiac and general
   angiography and are getting increasing attention in fluoroscopy. Two
   flat detector technologies prevail. The dominating method is based on an
   indirect X-ray conversion process, using cesium iodide scintillators. It
   offers considerable advantages in radiography, angiography and
   fluoroscopy. The other method employs a direct converter such as
   selenium which is particularly suitable for mammography. Both flat
   detector technologies are based on amorphous silicon active pixel
   matrices. Flat detectors facilitate the clinical workflow in
   radiographic rooms, foster improved image quality and provide the
   potential to reduce dose. This added value is based on their large
   dynamic range, their high sensitivity to X-rays and the instant
   availability of the image. Advanced image processing is instrumental in
   these improvements and expand the range of conventional diagnostic
   methods. In angiography and fluoroscopy the transition from image
   intensifiers to flat detectors is facilitated by ample advantages they
   offer, such as distortion-free images, excellent coarse contrast, large
   dynamic range and high X-ray sensitivity. These characteristics and
   their compatibility with strong magnetic fields are the basis for
   improved diagnostic methods and innovative interventional applications.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable and high capacity telecommunication networks spanning the
   country in its entirety reaching homes is imperative and essential
   pre-requisite to bridge the digital divide and the economic development
   of the nation. Today every policy initiative and strategy formulated by
   the government and private sectors, be it Broadband policy,
   e-governance, triple play, expanding telemedicine capabilities, distance
   education, computing grid for research and development or digital
   entertainment, assumes a robust, high speed and end-to-end connectivity
   infrastructure.
   Though there has been a considerable growth of telecom in India over the
   past few years and sizeable infrastructure has already been developed,
   in a vast country like India this touches only a smaller proportion of
   the population and the geographic spread. Last miles are still a problem
   area for many operators owing to lack of economic viability. Therefore,
   Innovative and non-conventional alternatives are to be explored for
   infrastructure expansion. Convergence of power and telecom
   infrastructures is viewed, world-over, as a viable alternative to
   address rapid expansion and better reach.
   Power transmission networks being the most pervasive and readily
   available network, are already being exploited as ready infrastructures
   for overlaying telecom networks (fiber networks). While the present
   level of infrastructure convergence is more on the backbone network side
   (use of Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) on power transmission
   infrastructure), innovative concepts such as Broadband over Power Line
   (BPL) unleashes a truly powerful convergence enabling delivery of high
   speed telecom bandwidth to home on existing power sockets thus promising
   not only a networked home but an intelligent power utility grid too.
   With the concept of BPL, power infrastructure provides an end-to-end
   infrastructure to build telecom highways and tributaries as well.
   This paper discusses the potential of power-telecom convergence in
   addressing the backbone, middle mile and last mile needs of telecom and
   also dwells on upcoming concept of BPL and the challenges posed.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-designed and -generated implant abutments will fundamentally
   change the present restorative protocols for implant dentistry. Standard
   implant prosthetic techniques rely on implant level impressions and
   costly casting technology for component fabrication. Many dentists are
   uncomfortable making implant level impressions and resort to
   time-consuming conventional techniques of intraoral abutment preparation
   or do not offer implants as a treatment alternative. Implant abutments
   generated by computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
   (CAD/CAM) are more precise than those created using traditional casting
   technology. This increased accuracy has specific application to implant
   dentistry, where precision of components may affect implant longevity,
   prosthetic success, and ease of restoration. Three current CAD/CAM
   implant abutment systems are reviewed, including an innovative digital
   system which eliminates the need to make implant level impressions.
   After placing an encoded healing abutment, an impression is made at the
   heating abutment level. The resulting cast is optically scanned and,
   using a CAD/CAM system, a patient specific definitive abutment is
   created. The encoded healing abutment is not removed until delivery of
   the abutment and final prosthesis. The ease and precision of making
   implant impressions at the healing abutment level, followed by
   patient-specific computer-generated abutments presents several benefits:
   restorative dentists rely less on conventional dental techniques to
   restore implants, inaccuracies of casting technology are virtually
   eliminated, laboratory technicians are freed to concentrate on higher
   level activities, and ultimately dentists are more likely to embrace
   implants as a preferred treatment option for their patients. This
   cutting edge technology of computer-assisted implant impressions and
   computer-generated abutments will likely replace traditional implant
   restorative protocols and become the standard for implant dentistry in
   the foreseeable future. (c) 2005 American Association of Oral and
   Maxillofacial Surgeons.}},

   primary education due to persistent and innovative efforts on the part
   of teachers; however, technology integration has not been as deep nor as
   broad in the secondary-level schools. Students have produced many new
   learning materials themselves using computer-based tools, the Internet,
   and other technologies. The barriers, challenges, and achievements of
   the community described in this case study may have implications for
   other small communities who wish to use technology for teaching,

Abstract = {{The main purpose of the SYRMEP (SYnchtotron Radiation for MEdical
   Physics) research team is the investigation and development of
   innovative techniques for medical imaging. A dedicated beamline has been
   built at ELETTRA to evaluate the effectiveness of synchrotron-based
   techniques in medical radiology with particular interest to mammography,
   and more in general, to the imaging of biological and biomedical
   samples, either in planar or tomographic set-ups. Taking advantage of
   the high intensity and high spatial coherence of Synchrotron Radiation
   (SR), phase sensitive techniques such as Phase Contrast (PhC) and
   Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI) can be applied. After successful
   studies carried out on test objects and in vitro samples, the research
   in mammography is aiming at in vivo clinical trials. For this purpose,
   the layout of the SYRMEP beamline has been substantially modified and
   the safety system has been completely redesigned to guarantee the
   compliance with current radiation protection guidelines. In the present
   paper, the main characteristics of the beamline and an overview of the
   results obtained in different contexts of biomedical imaging are
   presented. Moreover, the status of the project for clinical mammography
   is outlined. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have been exploring innovative technologies for elemental and
   hyperfine structure measurements using cavity ring-down spectroscopy
   (CRDS) combined with various plasma sources. A laboratory CRDS system
   utilizing a tunable dye laser is employed in this work to demonstrate
   the feasibility of the technology. An in-house fabricated sampling
   system is used to generate aerosols from solution samples and introduce
   the aerosols into the plasma source. The ring-down signals are monitored
   using a photomultiplier tube and recorded using a digital oscilloscope
   interfaced to a computer. Several microwave plasma discharge devices are
   tested for mercury CRDS measurement. Various discharge tubes have been
   designed and tested to reduce background interference and increase the
   sample path length while still controlling turbulence generated from the
   plasma gas flow. Significant background reduction has been achieved with
   the implementation of the newly designed tube-shaped plasma devices,
   which has resulted in a detection limit of 0.4 ng/mL for mercury with
   the plasma source CRDS. The calibration curves obtained in this work
   readily show that linearity over 2 orders of magnitude can be obtained
   with plasma-CRDS for mercury detection. In this work, the hyperfine
   structure of mercury at the experimental plasma temperatures is clearly
   identified. We expect that plasma source cavity ring-down spectroscopy
   will provide enhanced capabilities for elemental and isotopic
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidics is a rapidly developing field of innovation, which
   provides the chemical, medical and (bio)pharmaceutical industries with a
   much more efficient substitute for the use of well plates, syringes,
   etc., to perform multiple manipulation, and analysis of small samples.
   While conventional, continuous microfluidics and the manipulation of
   individual nano-droplets in ``Digital Microfluidics{''} are highly
   advanced, a major new dimension is added by our work on the flow of
   ordered foam and emulsion structures in specifically designed channel
   geometries. We show experimentally and computationally, utilizing both
   the quasi-static and Viscous Froth models, how the interplay between
   channel geometry and ordered foam/emulsion structures can be used to
   process tiny amounts of gases or liquids ill a highly reliable and
   efficient way. We have termed this method ``Discrete Microfluidics{''}
   and will introduce its various aspects in this paper, (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fluvial processes of cut and fill alluviation and channel abandonment or
   avulsion are essential for maintaining the ecological health of
   floodplain ecosystems characteristic of gravel-bed rivers. These dynamic
   processes shape the floodplain landscape, resulting in a shifting mosaic
   of habitats, both above and below ground. We present a new and
   innovative methodology to quantitatively assess the geomorphic work
   potential necessary to maintain a shifting habitat mosaic for gravel-bed
   river floodplains. This approach can be used to delineate critical
   habitats for preservation through land acquisition and conservation
   easements, often critical elements of river restoration plans worldwide.
   Spatially explicit modeling of water depth, flow velocity, shear stress,
   and stream power derived from surface hydraulic measurements was
   combined with airborne multispectral remote sensing for detailed
   modeling of floodplain water surfaces over tens to hundreds of square
   kilometers. The model results were then combined within a GIS framework
   to determine potential nodes of channel avulsion that delineate
   spatially explicit zones across the floodplain where the potential for
   geomorphic work is the greatest. Results of this study demonstrate the
   utility of integrating existing multispectral remote sensing data
   coupled with time-lagged ground-based measures of flow hydraulics to
   model fluvial processes at relatively fine spatial resolutions but over
   broad regional extents.}},

Abstract = {{Since the energy crisis of 1973, engineers have endeavoured to implement
   energy conservation in buildings. Unfortunately, their efforts have
   often resulted in energy saving which ignores the fundamental delivery
   of indoor satisfaction. Hence, either energy is conserved sacrificing
   indoor environmental quality (IEQ), or additional energy is consumed for
   the cooling of occupancy space. These misconceptions have prompted the
   development of an integrated design and operation protocol based on a
   so-called Building Environmental Performance Model (BEPM).
   The Building Environmental Performance Model links the IEQ and the
   building energy consumption together. It treats a building as a system.
   Energy consumption in the building services systems is the input to this
   system with the IEQ as the output. The BEP model incorporates two main
   modules: an adaptive comfort temperature control module (ACT) and a new
   CO2 demand control module (nDCV). These two modules (ACT and nDCV) take
   an innovative approach and help maintain satisfaction levels as well as
   optimum energy consumption.
   The BEP model was built into an algorithm for implementation in a Direct
   Digital Control system. It was used in a longitudinal monitoring study
   in a typical Hong Kong office, so that the usefulness of the model could
   be verified. It was found that the BEPM was able to save up to 15\% of
   total energy used, and maintain the occupant dissatisfaction rate of
   thermal comfort and indoor air quality at around 20\%.
   The incentive of the BEPM can be deduced from a simple life cycle
   costing analysis. It assumes an inflation rate and bank interest rate of
   8 and 10\%, respectively, the total net present value (NPV) for the
   original airside system is higher than that employing the BEPM by HK\$
   19,700,000 for 20 years of operation. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The aging and obsolescence of Automatic Test Systems (ATS) is causing
   many programs to look at re-hosting their Test Program Sets (TPSs) to
   modern test systems. The major problem is that this undertaking is both
   time-consuming and expensive. With budgets decreasing, program managers
   have to find innovative ways to do more with less. To find those
   innovative ways, we must look at non-traditional methods of TPS
   development. We must be willing to consider that there are alternate
   solutions, and we must take them into consideration when making a
   decision on which ATS to re-host our TPSs. This paper will discuss one
   of the alternative solutions to re-hosting TPSs that will realize
   significant savings in both time and money over the use of traditional
   ATS. Specifically we will talk about using an in circuit test system
   (Pinpoint II from DiagnoSYS Systems, Inc.) to re-host digital circuit
   boards from a legacy ATS and the techniques used to accomplish this
   task. This approach is not intended to fit all situations, but in the
   right situation, it can be very effective. To get the most out of this
   approach, it is important to identify exactly which TPSs are good
   candidates, and which are not. To illustrate how this can be done, the
   process used by the AWACS program to find a cost-effective way of
   re-hosting TPSs from their obsolete depot tester (AN/GSM-285) will be
   outlined. The outline will describe the criteria used to determine which
   circuit cards are good candidates, and the differences in techniques
   used with this approach compared to traditional TPS development. It will
   also describe the limitations as well as the benefits obtained by using
   this approach. Examples will be given that illustrate the cost savings
   that can be realized over the use of traditional ATS.}},

   to an end on 31 July 2003 but the project was then extended until July
   2004. The chapter, reporting on the findings of the initial pilot, will
   discuss the development of the process, the responses of students and

Abstract = {{A simple homodyne direct digital demodulation technique that is
   insensitive to sensor induced phase-error and its innovative FPGA
   implementation axe presented here. This novel demodulation scheme does
   not need a low pass filter; thereby the inherent filter time lag is
   eliminated. A direct digital read-out of the demodulated signal, i.e.,
   the measurand value, is obtained through analog-to-digital conversion of
   the modulated signal at an instant that coincides with its peak. This
   peak sampling eliminates the processor time required in quadrature
   demodulators to obtain the measurand from the in-phase and quadrature
   components, For this purpose a quadrature square wave is first generated
   from the reference carrier. Digital measures of carrier time period and
   sensor induced time lag/lead axe used to ensure that the rising edges of
   this quadrature square wave coincide with the peak instants of the
   modulated signal. The required sampling instants for digitization of the
   modulated signal are generated in synchronism with its rising edges. The
   digital read-out of the measurand is directly obtained without taking
   recourse to the standard sequence of multiplication, low-pass filtering
   and the subsequent processing common in existing synchronous
   phase-sensitive demodulators. With an a priori knowledge of the
   sensor-type used, this innovative FPGA-based implementation accommodates
   sensors introducing lagging or leading phase-shift in the modulated
   carrier.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the modeling and simulation of power supply voltage
   transients (Delta V-DD) in digital SoC (Systems on a Chip), namely their
   impact on SoC core's performance. The goal is to verify, in a
   cost-effective way, core's fault tolerance to this disturbance, aiming
   at EMI/EMC standard compliance. The two key parameters are the time
   slack and the defect size. A top-down approach is used to introduce an
   innovative fault injection and simulation technique. In fact, fault
   simulation is carried out either by using faulty delays (defect size as
   a function of Delta V-DD magnitude) in the CUT (Core Under Test) and
   nominal time excitation rate, or by using a fault-free CUT description
   and faster test application times (speed-up proportional to Delta V-DD
   magnitude). A bottom-up approach, using electrical simulation, is
   extensively used to demonstrate the adequacy of exploiting this duality
   between time excitation and delay response, for combinational CUT. We
   refer this duality as the ``accordion{''} effect. For sequential
   circuits, and for pipeline circuits, it is shown that the tolerance to
   Delta V-DD disturbances is significantly lower than the one observed in
   combinational CUT, due to de-synchronization effects in storage
   elements. This effect depends on the clock distribution network and is a
   consequence of differently delayed responses of the CUT and of the clock
   network. Results are demonstrated using basic infrastructures and ISCAS
   benchmark circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Although functionalities of engineering systems are rocketing, they
   currently cannot cope with the development of new engineering methods.
   Additionally, the data management systems and concepts of today fail to
   adequately support these innovative functionalities. The integration of
   new methods into existing and new system environments are often not
   taken into account. In addition to the optimization of individual tool
   functionalities, integrated system architectures are needed. This paper
   will take a look at today's and tomorrow's engineering practices,
   showing that major benefits can only be achieved if based on a thorough
   concept of engineering system integration. Different integration
   concepts are elaborated, with some of them being already applied in a
   prototypical implementation in existing processes. First results are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For separate reasons, schools of nursing and public television stations
   are finding it a matter of mutual interest to work together in the
   production of distance education content for college nursing students in
   their communities. The advent of digital television (DTV) broadcasting
   has given these distance education partnerships new capabilities for
   reaching more potential students. In this article, I review one
   innovative collaboration between several nursing education programs and
   a public broadcasting service member station in South Texas. In this
   pilot project, nursing faculty were trained in television production
   techniques and became producers of DTV instructional video material.
   This case study demonstrates a number of ways in which nursing distance
   education programs can benefit by designing and delivering course
   material via digital broadcasting. It also highlights several
   difficulties that should be considered by distance educators prior to
   embarking on DTV curriculum development projects.}},

   telecommunication industry in China. We apply a modified version of Lee
   and Lim's {[}Lee, K., Lim, C., 2001. The technological regimes, catch-up
   and leapfrogging: findings from the Korean industries. Research Policy,
   vol. 30.] model of technological learning and catching-up. Using the
   three cases of the Shanghai Bell, the CIT-led R\&D consortium, and
   indigenous companies such as Huawei, we analyze how the catching-up in
   the telecommunication industry occurred. We find that the important
   factors in the catch-up are the strategy of ``trading market for
   technology,{''} the knowledge diffusion from Shanghai Bell both to the
   R\&D consortium and to Huawei, and industrial promotion by the
   government. As a condition for successful catch-up, the paper points out
   that the technological regime of the telephone switches is featured by a
   more predictable technological trajectory and a lower cumulativeness.
   These conditions and strategies helped the Chinese firms to achieve a
   stage-skipping catch-up, namely, by skipping the stage of analogue
   electronic switches to jump to digital electronic switches. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{This exploratory article sets out to examine if and how the new digital
   copyright laws in the U.S. and Europe are affecting innovation on the
   Internet. It argues that these laws, in balance, at least to date, are
   having a positive effect on Internet innovation, despite the strident
   argument that these laws will inhibit innovation. The innovations the
   article discusses are peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing technology and the
   new business models for music retailing that P2P has spawned. It
   concludes that digital copyright laws could create perverse incentives
   for innovation and wonders if legislators may not require a better
   understanding of the innovation process when crafting IP laws. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Relationships among the multiple events that precede the mitochondrial
   membrane permeability transition (MPT) are not yet clearly understood. A
   combination of newly developed instrumental and computational approaches
   to this problem is described. The instrumental innovation is a
   high-resolution digital apparatus for the simultaneous, real-time
   measurement of four mitochondrial parameters as indicators of the
   respiration rate, membrane potential, calcium ion transport, and
   mitochondrial swelling. A computational approach is introduced that
   tracks the fraction of mitochondria that has undergone pore opening.
   This approach allows multiple comparisons on a single time scale. The
   validity of the computational approach for studying complex
   mitochondrial phenomena was evaluated with mitochondria undergoing an
   MPT induced by Ca2+, phenylarsine oxide or alamethicin. Selective ion
   leaks were observed that precede the permeability transition and that
   are inducer specific. These results illustrate the occurrence of
   inducer-specific sequential changes associated with the induction of the
   permeability transition. Analysis of the temporal relationship among the
   multiple mitochondrial parameters of isolated mitochondria should
   provide insights into the mechanisms underlying these responses. (c)

Abstract = {{Future `on-demand' computing systems, often depicted as potentially
   large scale and complex Service-Oriented Architectures, will need
   innovative management approaches for controlling and matching services
   demand and supply. Centralized optimization approaches reach their
   bounds with increasing network size and number of nodes. The search for
   decentralized approaches has led to build on self-organization concepts
   like Autonomic Computing, which draw their inspiration from Biology.
   This article shows how an alternative self-organization concept from
   Economics, the Catallaxy concept of F.A. von Hayek, can be realized for
   allocating service supply and demand in a distributed `on-demand' web
   services network. Its implementation using a network simulator allows
   evaluating the approach against a centralized resource broker, by
   dynamically varying connection reliability and node density in the
   network. Exhibiting Autonomic Computing properties, the Catallaxy
   realization outperforms a centralized broker in highly dynamic
   environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the ePerSpace research project which aims to
   significantly increase user acceptance of networked audiovisual systems
   and applications at home and virtually anywhere by enabling innovative
   interoperable value-added personalised networked services and
   applications. Moreover, it aims to develop an open architecture and a
   framework that will significantly increase the speed of developing novel
   value-added personalised services by reusing well-defined system
   components with open APIs. The structure of the paper follows the
   methodology of the project. It starts with a vision of future
   personalised services from the users' perspective by developing five
   scenarios. These scenarios are then used to extract the requirements of
   the personalisation framework which is then described in terms of its
   personalisation, service management, digital home environment management
   and content adaptation capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness of an
   ERP-compatible Digit Span Backward (ERP-DB) task to determine working
   memory abilities in healthy participants.
   Methods: Participants were administered both the standard digit span
   backward and ERP-DB tasks. The ERP-DB task was divided into two
   sections, consisting of 2, 4, 6 and 8 (Group 1) and 3, 5, and 7 (Group
   2) set sizes. A set of digits was aurally presented, followed by a
   second set that either corresponded to the reverse order of the first
   set (correct condition) or had one digit in the sequence replaced by an
   incorrect digit (incorrect condition).
   Results: Two posterior positive components were found to distinguish the
   two conditions; an earlier positive component (P200/P300) was elicited
   in the correct condition, whereas a comparatively robust and prolonged
   positive slow wave (PSW) was elicited in the incorrect condition.
   Furthermore, the PSW and the difference in PSW amplitude between
   incorrect and correct conditions (dPSW) dissipated as working memory
   load increased and were related to working memory capacity.
   Conclusions: The PSW, dPSW and P200/P300 components were found to be
   associated with working memory abilities and may have the potential to
   act as neurophysiological markers for the assessment of working memory
   capacity.
   Significance: This research lends support for the utility of the ERP-DB
   task as a means of assessing working memory abilities, which may have
   implications for testing patients with expressive communication
   impairments. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical

   as a means for firms to meet the rising challenge, faced by a large
   variety of manufacturers, to offer innovative highly personalized
   products with short and reliable delivery delays in a digital and global
   economy that is highly turbulent and competitive. It positions
   personalizing versus the current trend of mass customising. It
   characterizes complementary types of personalizing and highlights the
   key elements for their successful implementation from a demand and
   supply network perspective. Finally, it illustrates the scope and
   addresses how personalizing affects the design of the demand and supply
   network, emphasizing the scope of this design influence, the variety of
   options for each element of the network, and the interrelationships
   between the design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed knowledge of the light distribution characteristics through
   advanced window systems is required to improve the visual comfort of the
   building's occupants while controlling the propagation of daylight in
   rooms and the solar gains. An innovative bidirectional goniophotometer
   has recently been set up for this purpose, using digital image capture
   and the projection of the emerging light on a diffusing screen. It
   therefore provides a continuous investigation of the bidirectional
   transmission figures in a time-efficient way. This instrument was
   converted into a double-purpose device, allowing both transmission and
   reflection measurements, which induced several strong constraints due to
   the conflict of incident and emerging light flux in reflection mode: on
   one hand the incident beam had to be restricted to the sample area only;
   on the other hand, as the screen obstructed the incoming light flux in
   some positions, a special opening in the latter was required. The
   practical answer to these constraints, detailed in this paper, proved to
   be reliable, appropriate and efficient. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) after liver transplantation is a severe
   complication which may lead to graft infarction and subsequent graft
   loss. It complicates 2-12\% of adult liver transplantations (1, 2) and
   subsequently leads to retransplantation in 50-75\% of patients (3).
   Fortunately, innovations in Doppler ultrasonography and digital
   angiography technologies have provided an accurate and rapid method for
   detecting HAT before ischemic damage of the allograft (4).
   Revascularization procedures that can be performed once the diagnosis of
   HAT has been confirmed include thrombectomy alone, intrahepatic arterial
   thrombolysis with thrombolytic agents, creation of a new anastomosis
   between a moreproximal part of the recipient artery and a more distal
   part of the donor hepatic artery, and introduction of an interposition
   graft (3). Early diagnosis is a prerequisite for these revascularization
   strategies.
   Weeport here the case of a patient with previous orthotopic liver
   transplantation (OLT) and splenectomy in whom hepatic arterial
   reconstruction using saphenous vein graft between the splenic artery and
   the transplant hepatic artery following HAT was performed.}},

Abstract = {{A 12-GHz monolithic silicon bipolar receiver for digital video
   broadcasting via satellite (DVB-S) is presented. The receiver is based
   on a dual-conversion superheterodyne architecture that employs a single
   LO integrated in the same die. To comply with the stringent LO phase
   noise requirement of -101 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier, an
   innovative VCO topology, based on a three-layer monolithic transformer,
   was used. The VCO exhibits a phase noise of -102 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz
   offset from a 5.3-GHz carrier and a 1.1-GHz tuning range. At 12 GHz, the
   conversion gain is 33.6 dB, the single-sideband noise figure is 5.9 dB
   and the output IP3 is + 16 dBm. This work reports the first 12-GHz DVB-S
   monolithic receiver integrated in a low-cost silicon bipolar technology.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative burst-mode laser transmitter (BM-TX) is presented for
   gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) upstream transmission at
   1.25 Gb/s. The laser bias and modulation current each can reach 80 mA
   with a resolution of 0.1 mA providing a total drive current up to 160
   mA. Both currents are generated by 10-bit current steering
   digital-to-analog converters (DACs), the architecture of which is
   specially adapted to yield a monotonic current setting at settling times
   below 12.8 ns. Tests show that fast automatic power control (APC) can
   stabilize and track the launched optical power with a tolerance of less
   than I dB over a wide temperature range for outdoor operation. The APC
   only requires a straightforward calibration of the ``0{''} and the
   ``1{''} level at room temperature. Optical level monitoring on strings
   of four consecutive ``0{''} bytes and two consecutive ``1{''} bytes at
   1.25 Gb/s is demonstrated. APC based on such short strings of data has
   not been shown before.
   The circuits have been designed in a 0.35 mu m SiGe BiCMOS process.
   Experimental results show that this dc-coupled BM-TX meets the
   specifications of the recently approved ITU-T Recommendation G.984.2
   supporting an intelligent power leveling mechanism (PLM).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiresolution general-purpose high-speed machine
   vision sensor with on-chip image processing capabilities. The sensor
   comprises an innovative multiresolution sensing area, 1536 A/D
   converters, and a SIMD array of 1536 bit-serial processors with
   corresponding memory. The sensing area consists of an area part with
   1536 x 512 pixels, and a line-scan part with a set of rows with 3072
   pixels each. The SIMD processor array can deliver more than 100 GOPS
   sustained and the on-chip pixel-analysing rate can be as high as 4 G
   pixels/s. The sensor is ideal for high-speed multisense imaging where,
   e.g., color, greyscale, internal material light scatter, and 3-D
   profiles are captured simultaneously. When running only 3-D laser
   triangulation, a data rate of more than 20 000 profiles/s can be
   achieved when delivering 1536 range values per profile with 8 bits of
   range resolution. Experimental results showing very good image
   characteristics and a good digital to analog noise isolation are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The silicon vertex tracker (SVT) of the BaBar experiment at PEP-H is
   described. This is the crucial device for the measurement of the B meson
   decay vertices to extract charge-conjugation parity (CP) asymmetries. It
   consists of five layers of double-sided ac-coupled silicon strip
   detectors, read out by a full-custom integrated circuit, capable of
   simultaneous acquisition, digitization, and transmission of data. It
   represents the core of the BaBar tracking system, providing position
   measurements with a precision of 10 mu m (inner layers) and 30 mu m
   (outer layers). The relevant performances of the SVT are presented, and
   the experience acquired during the construction, installation, and the
   first five years of data-taking is described. Innovative solutions are
   highlighted, like the sophisticated alignment procedure, imposed by the
   design of the silicon tracker, integrated in the beamline elements and
   mechanically separated from the other parts of BaBar. The harshness of
   the background conditions in the interaction region required several
   studies on the radiation damage of the sensors and the front-end chips,
   whose results are presented. Over the next five years the luminosity is
   predicted to increase by a factor three, leading to radiation and
   occupancy levels significantly exceeding the detector design.
   Extrapolation of future radiation doses and occupancies is shown
   together with the expected detector performance and lifetime. Upgrade
   scenarios to deal with the increased luminosity and backgrounds are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{CONTEXT The ability to perform clinical procedures safely is a key skill
   for health care professionals. Performing such procedures on conscious
   patients is challenging and requires a combination of technical and
   communication skills. We have developed quasi-clinical scenarios, where
   inanimate models attached to simulated patients provide a convincing
   learning environment. Procedures are rated by expert observers and by
   the `patient' and recorded for subsequent review. This study explores
   the potential of locating such scenarios within a real clinical setting,
   allowing participants to experience the challenges of the workplace
   while ensuring patient safety. An innovative portable digital recording
   device (the `Virtual Chaperone') is evaluated for use in clinical
   settings.
   METHODS A qualitative design (observation and interview studies)
   investigated volunteer medical students undertaking 2 procedure
   scenarios (insertion of urinary catheter and wound closure with sutures)
   within the accident unit of a large London hospital. All procedures were
   observed in real time and recorded digitally (using the Virtual
   Chaperone). A protocol was used for structured feedback. Observational
   and interview data was analysed using standard qualitative techniques.
   RESULTS Seven sessions with 22 undergraduate medical students took place
   over 9 months within 1 centre. Data confirmed the feasibility of using a
   moveable, self-contained training scenario within an authentic clinical
   setting. Overall, the response from participants was positive.
   CONCLUSION Scenario-based teaching within an authentic clinical
   environment is feasible and perceived by participants to be
   educationally useful. This approach blurs traditional boundaries between
   skills laboratory teaching and clinical practice and may offer
   considerable advantages in training for clinical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe and to evaluate a novel confocal scanning laser
   ophthalmoscope (cSLO) for fluorescence angiography, fundus
   autofluorescence (FAF), and red-free imaging.
   Methods: Digital infrared, red-free, FAF, fluorescein, and indocyanine
   green (ICG) angiography images were obtained with a cSLO in 766
   patients. An optically pumped solid-state laser generates the excitation
   wavelength (488 nm) required for red-free, FAF, and fluorescein
   angiography images. For ICG angiography and infrared imaging, diode
   laser sources at 790 and 820 nm are used. Further features include an
   internal fixation control and a focus range of -24 to +30 diopters.
   Results: High-image quality is achieved with a resolution of up to 5 mu
   m per pixel in 30-x 30-degree images and allows for accurate delineation
   of normal and pathologic features. Simultaneous angiography offers
   high-contrast images. Corresponding display of quasi-simultaneous frames
   facilitates interpretation. A small focus difference between fluorescein
   and ICG scans occurs because of chromatic aberrations. Automated
   alignment and generation of mean images from several single frames allow
   for acquisition of high-resolution FAF images.
   Conclusion: Various laser-source related, optical, and electronic
   innovations improve cSLO fundus imaging for routine clinical
   application. A solid-state laser has advantages compared to argon gas
   laser sources, including less space occupation, heat emission, and noise
   production.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of wind loading on seedlings of English oak (Quercus robur
   L.) was investigated. Instead of using a traditional wind tunnel, an
   innovative ventilation system was designed. This device was set up in
   the field and composed of a rotating arm supporting an electrical fan,
   which emitted an air current similar to that of wind loading. Oaks were
   sown from seed in a circle around the device. A block of control plants
   was situated nearby, and was not subjected to artificial wind loading.
   After 7 months, 16 plants from each treatment were excavated, and root
   architecture and morphological characteristics measured using a 3D
   digitiser. The resulting geometrical and topological data were then
   analysed using AMAPmod software. Results showed that total lateral root
   number and length in wind stressed plants were over two times greater
   than that in control trees. However, total lateral root volume did not
   differ significantly between treatments. In comparing lateral root
   characters between the two populations, it was found that mean root
   length, diameter and volume were similar between the two treatments. In
   trees subjected to wind loading, an accentuated asymmetry of root
   distribution and mean root length was found between the windward and
   leeward sides of the root system, with windward roots being
   significantly more numerous and longer than leeward roots. However, no
   differences were found when the two sectors perpendicular to the wind
   direction were compared. Mean tap root length was significantly higher
   in control samples compared to wind stressed plants, whilst mean
   diameter was greater in the latter. Wind loading appears to result in
   increased growth of lateral roots at the expense of the tap root.
   Development of the lateral root system may therefore ensure better
   anchorage of young trees subjected to wind loading under certain
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays companies operate in a difficult environment: the dynamics of
   innovations increase and product life cycles become shorter. Furthermore
   products and the corresponding manufacturing processes get more and more
   complex. Therefore, companies need new methods for the planning of
   manufacturing systems. One promising approach in this context is digital
   factory/virtual production-the modeling and analysis of computer models
   of the planned factory with the objective to reduce time and costs, For
   the modeling and analysis various simulation methods and programs have
   been developed. They are a highly valuable support for planning and
   visualizing the manufacturing system. But there is one major
   disadvantage: only experienced and long trained experts are able to
   operate with these programs. The graphical user interface is very
   complex and not intuitive to use. This results in an extensive and
   error-prone modeling of complex simulation models and a time-consuming
   interpretation of the simulation results.
   To overcome these weak points, intuitive and understandable man-machine
   interfaces like augmented and virtual reality can be used. This paper
   describes the architecture of a system which uses the technologies of
   augmented and virtual reality to support the planning process of complex
   manufacturing systems. The proposed system assists the user in modeling,
   the validation of the simulation model, and the subsequent optimization
   of the production system. A general application of the VR- and
   AR-technologies and of the simulation is realized by the development of
   appropriate linking and integration mechanisms. For the visualization of
   the arising 3D-data within the VR- and AR-environments. a dedicated
   3D-rendering library is used, (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The error robustness of digital communication systems using source and
   channel coding can be improved by iterative source-channel decoding
   (ISCD). The turbo-like evaluation of natural residual source redundancy
   and of artificial channel coding redundancy makes step-wise quality
   gains possible by several iterations. The maximum number of profitable
   iterations is predictable by an EXIT chart analysis. In this
   contribution, we exploit the EXIT chart representation to improve the
   error correcting/concealing capabilities of ISCD schemes. We propose new
   design guidelines to select appropriate bit mappings and to design the
   channel coding component. A parametric source coding scheme with some
   residual redundancy is assumed. Applying both innovations, the new
   EXIT-optimized index assignment as well as the appropriately designed
   recursive nonsystematic convolutional (RNSC) code allow to outperform
   known approaches to ISCD by far in the most relevant channel conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Hyper-capitalism in global information and communication technology
   (ICT) markets during the late 1990s created a new global production
   network, shaped by multinational corporations, international capital
   flows, and a flourishing of high-tech entrepreneurship. Each of the
   cities considered here benefited substantially from this growth, but
   their positions as nodes in the ICT global production network differed
   markedly, as did their ability to appropriate the Value they generated.
   In Dublin, value creation was based largely on inward technology and
   capital flows, although indigenous Dublin-based software companies did
   demonstrate their ability to compete internationally. ICT development in
   Helsinki and Tel Aviv drew more strongly on the local knowledge base,
   and benefited from changes in national regulatory and political
   conditions. In Helsinki, public and private R\&D investments supported
   the highly effective globalisation strategy of Nokia to create a
   strongly localised, vertically-integrated and strongly specialised
   sector. Value creation in the more diverse Israeli ICT sector was also
   based primarily on locally developed technology, university R\&D and the
   commercialisation of technology developed initially for military
   applications. By the end of the 1990s, the resulting ICT node in Tel
   Aviv was grounded in the local knowledge-base, technologically diverse,
   strongly entrepreneurial and globally oriented. \&COPY; 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a
   short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the
   formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted
   until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g.,
   sweeping resonances. excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most
   planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind
   continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present
   day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size
   distribution over Solar System history Ming a collisional evolution
   Model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly
   include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown
   size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical
   depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints
   were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the
   asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the
   cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the
   relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over
   the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial
   main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption
   scaling law Q{*}(D). In contrast to previous efforts, we find Our
   derived Q{*}(D) function is very similar to results produced by
   numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit
   results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over
   its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state
   approximately 3.9-4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's
   wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a ``fossil{''} from this
   violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D 120 km asteroids are
   primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the
   accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of
   fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and
   lightcurve distributious near D similar to 100-120 km are likely to be a
   byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on Our results imply the
   primordial main belt population (in the form of D < 1000 km bodies) was
   150-250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent
   dynamical simulations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of detecting atherosclerotic
   vascular disease using an innovative magnetic resonance angiography
   (MRA) protocol in combination with a dedicated whole-body MR scanner
   with new surface coil technology.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 10 volunteers and eight patients with
   peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) were examined at 1.5 T.
   Conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the symptomatic
   region was available as a reference standard in all eight patients.
   Depending on subjects' size, four to five three-dimensional data sets
   were acquired using an adapted injection protocol. Images were assessed
   independently by two readers for vascular pathology. Additionally,
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were
   measured.
   Results: Whole-body MRA yielded excellent sensitivity and specificity of
   more than 95\% for both readers with high interobserver agreement (k =
   0.93). Surface coil signal reception rendered a high SNR (mean 151.28
   +/- 54.04) and CNR (mean 120.75 +/- 46.47). Despite lower SNR and CNR of
   the cranial and cervical vessels, a two-step injection protocol
   exhibited less venous superposition and therefore proved to be superior
   compared to single-bolus injection.
   Conclusion: Our approach provides accurate noninvasive high-resolution
   imaging of systemic atherosclerotic disease, covering the arterial
   vasculature from intracranial arteries to distal runoff vessels. The
   recently introduced MR scanner and coil technology is feasible to
   significantly increase the performance of whole-body MRA.}},

Abstract = {{The exploration of the design space for heterogeneous Systems on Chip (
   SoC) becomes more and more important. As modern SoCs include a variety
   of different architecture blocks ensuring flexibility as well as highest
   performance, it is mandatory to prune the design space in an early stage
   of the design process in order to achieve short innovation cycles for
   new products. Thus, the goal of this work is to provide estimations of
   implementation specific parameters like throughput rate, power
   dissipation and silicon area by means of cost functions featuring
   reasonable accuracy at low modeling effort. A model based exploration
   strategy supporting the design flow for heterogeneous SoCs is presented.
   In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this exploration strategy, in
   a first step implementation cost parameters are provided for a variety
   of basic operations frequently required in digital signal processing
   which were implemented on discrete components like DSPs, FPGAs or
   dedicated ASICs. These implementation parameters serve as a basis for
   deriving cost models for the design space exploration concept.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen growing sociological interest in the role that
   objects and non-human actors perform in everyday life. Whether as
   machines, information technologies, artworks, commodities or
   architectures, objects today raise issues of complexity and controversy
   (Pels et al., 2002). Borrowing from actornetwork theory the idea that
   humans and nonhumans are actively involved in the making of social
   worlds, there are already those who call for a post-social world and an
   object-centred sociality (Knorr-Cetina, 1997). But how can non-humans be
   observed? Sociologists are accustomed to socio-constructionist
   approaches to the sociology of science, or to analyses of tools and
   innovations couched in terms of networks of actants; methodologically,
   however, it seems that ideas about how to proceed methodologically are
   not very well worked out. On the basis of a four-month ethnography
   conducted in a hospital that has recently introduced a digital clinical
   records system, 1 discuss the methodological aspects of shadowing
   non-humans. In particular, adopting Star's insight of an `ethnography of
   the infrastructure' (Star, 1999), 1 concentrate on how to account for
   contexts characterized by multiple and non-homogeneous actors and
   practices and on the implications of such a perspective for
   organizational analysis.}},

   members participate in activities facilitated by these new technologies,
   and second, the `digital divide' separating organizational strata. Data
   from Danish and Norwegian party member and party congress delegate
   surveys conducted in 2000/01 indicate that ICTs have become fully
   integrated parts of party work among top-level and middle-level elites,
   and that the extent to which rank-and-file party members participate in
   these activities remains limited. Even though some members who did not
   engage in traditional party activities were attracted by these new
   activities, the Impact was limited during the early 2000s.}},

   Evaluation of an innovation}},

Abstract = {{Background. Common acute illness challenges everyone involved in child
   care. Impoverished inner-city families, whose children are most burdened
   by morbidity and whose reliance on child care is most important, are
   those least equipped to deal with this challenge.
   Objective. To assess the impact of telemedicine on absence from child
   care due to illness (ADI).
   Design/Methods. A before-and-after design with historical and concurrent
   controls was used to study ADI in 5 inner-city child care centers in
   Rochester, New York, between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2003.
   Enrollment averaged 138 children per center, of whom Medicaid covered
   66\%. Center 5 provided only concurrent controls. Telemedicine service
   began in the first 4 centers in a staggered fashion starting in May
   2001. Baseline data on ADI before availability of telemedicine were
   collected in each center for a minimum of 18 weeks. The telemedicine
   model for diagnosis and treatment of common acute problems involved both
   real-time and store-and-forward information exchange between a child and
   telemedicine assistant in child care and an office-based telemedicine
   clinician. Devices used were an all-purpose digital camera ( with
   attachments designed to facilitate capture of ear, nose, throat, skin,
   and eye images) and an electronic stethoscope. ADI indexed illness that
   had interrupted care and education for children and burdened both
   parents and the community with work loss and health care-related costs.
   Detailed attendance records and staff and parent interviews provided
   data. The total number of days of attendance expected from all
   registered children over the course of a week ( total child-days) served
   as the denominator in calculating rates for ADI. The center-week served
   as the primary unit of analysis. This study is descriptive in character;
   statistics are not inferential but instead serve to summarize
   observations.
   Results. For the 400 weeks of valid observations contributed by the 5
   centers, the mean ADI was 6.41 absences per 100 child-days per week. In
   bivariate analysis, predictors of ADI were children's mean age, child
   care center, proportion of children covered by Medicaid, season of the
   year, and availability of telemedicine. ADI during weeks with
   telemedicine (4.07 absences per 100 child-days) was less than half that
   during weeks without telemedicine (8.78 absences per 100 child-days).
   After adjusting for potentially confounding variables using the
   generalized estimating equations method, telemedicine remained the
   strongest predictor of ADI. A 63\% reduction in ADI was attributable to
   telemedicine, an effect similar to the 59\% variation in ADI with season
   of the year. During the 201 total weeks that telemedicine services were
   available, 940 telemedicine encounters occurred. Telemedicine clinicians
   for these 940 encounters recommended exclusion from child care for 7.0\%
   and in-person visits for 2.8\% of the children. In surveys, parents
   indicated that 91.2\% of telemedicine contacts allowed them to stay at
   work and that 93.8\% of problems managed by telemedicine would otherwise
   have led to an office or emergency department visit.
   Conclusions. Telemedicine holds substantial potential to reduce the
   impact of illness on health and education of children, on time lost from
   work in parents, and on absenteeism in the economy.}},

Title = {{The digital revolution in qualitative research: Working with digital
   audio data through Atlas.Ti}},

Abstract = {{Modern versions of Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software
   ( CAQDAS) are enabling the analysis of audio sound files instead of
   relying solely on text-based analysis. Along with other developments in
   computer technologies such as the proliferation of digital recording
   devices and the potential for using streamed media in online academic
   publication, this innovation is increasing the possibilities of
   systematically using media-rich, naturalistic data in place of
   transcribed `de-naturalised' forms. This paper reports on a project
   assessing online learning materials that used Atlas. ti software to
   analyse sound files, and it describes the problems faced in gathering,
   analysing and using this data for report writing. It concludes that
   there are still serious barriers to the full and effective integration
   of audio data into qualitative research: the absence of `industry
   standard' recording technology, the underdevelopment of audio interfaces
   in Atlas. ti ( as a key CAQDAS package), and the conventional approach
   to data use in many online publication formats all place serious
   restrictions on the integrated use of this data. Nonetheless, it is
   argued here that there are clear benefits in pushing for resolutions to
   these problems as the use of this naturalistic data through digital
   formats may help qualitative researchers to overcome some long-standing
   methodological issues: in particular, the ability to overcome the
   reliance on data transcription rather than `natural' data, and the
   possibility of implementing research reports that facilitate a more
   transparent use of `reusable' data, are both real possibilities when
   using these digital technologies, which could substantially change the
   shape of qualitative research practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the digital divide in rural Jiangsu, one of the most
   developed areas in China. First, it reveals that only a small portion of
   rural enterprises have access to the Internet, and the penetration rate
   of the Internet in rural enterprises of China is much lower than that in
   urban enterprises revealed by previous studies. Second, a significant
   digital divide exists between Southern Jiangsu on the one hand and
   Middle and Northern Jiangsu on the other hand. Indeed, the Internet
   penetration rate in Zhangjiagang is very close to that in urban
   enterprises. Thirdly, this study finds that large and old enterprises
   are more likely to have access to the Internet. Fourthly, Internet
   access demonstrates very strong and positive relationships with
   enterprises' economic and innovative performance, though it is not clear
   whether or not the better performance at rural enterprises with Internet
   access comes from their usage of the Internet. The implication of the
   study is that governments should promote Internet usage among rural
   enterprises. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Convergence affects modern electronic communications (both networks and
   services) as well as a great variety of innovative broadcasting
   applications. It offers significant potential for growth, investments
   and productivity, thus providing opportunities for development in fully
   liberalised and competitive environments. In particular, the `proper'
   creation, use, distribution and delivery of various forms of content
   constitute major challenges for European businesses, for the benefit of
   all `actors' involved (public and private sector). The promotion and the
   endorsement of common regulatory principles and/or measures are of
   particular importance to extend the relevant novel perspectives of the
   markets. This article mainly investigates various points of view,
   originating from recent European regulatory initiatives, towards
   establishing suitable conditions for technical, business and commercial
   evolution. We assess the `core' provisions of the corresponding
   initiatives, including enhanced electronic communications, audio- and
   TV-programme related activities, electronic commerce, intellectual
   property rights and copyright, digital rights management, privacy
   issues, consumers' interests and many more. Content is a crucial factor

Abstract = {{The diffusion of Internet technology among firms is widely considered to
   be one of the primary factors behind the rapid economic growth of the
   1990s. However, little systematic study has examined the variation in
   firm decisions to adopt the Internet. I explore the sources of this
   variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large
   sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998.
   I show how prior information technology (IT) investments land workplace
   organization decisions affect the returns to adopting simple and complex
   Internet technologies. I show that recent investments in client/server
   (C/S) networking applications have competing effects on the likelihood
   of Internet adoption. Such investments can slow adoption by acting as a
   short-run substitute or by creating ``switching costs.{''} Geographic
   dispersion of employees is complementary with Internet adoption,
   suggesting that Internet technology lowered internal coordination costs.
   Increases in organization size and external pressure also increase the
   likelihood of adoption.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid heat transfer is crucial for an efficient polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), and this makes temperature control one of the most
   essential features in a micro-PCR system, which always includes a heater
   and a sensor composing a closed-loop. Yet, the fabrication of the heater
   and the sensor often prevented micro-PCR systems from achieving both
   cost-effectiveness and fabrication-easiness. For most of the early
   researches micromachining techniques were used to allow sensors and
   heaters be integrated on a silicon or glass chip. However, the cost
   prevented them from wide applications. The work described in this paper
   is part of our effort to solve the cost/fabrication dilemma. An
   innovative digital temperature control system was developed by
   introducing a heater/sensor switching procedure. Only one temperature
   controlling element fabricated by flexible printed circuit technology
   was utilized in the constructed PCR device with minimum fabrication
   steps. The glass chip-based device was made from low cost materials and
   assembled with adhesive bonding. Through seemingly simple steps. we
   obtained both disposability and portability at the same time.
   Temperature stability within +/- 0.3 degrees C and a transitional rate
   of 8 degrees C/s during heating/cooling was achieved. A 244 bp DNA
   fragment of hepatitis C virus was successfully amplified in our device
   by a three-stage thermal cycling process. Further improvement was
   assisted by finite element analysis, and demonstrated by experiment. (c)

Abstract = {{Modem research has broadened scientific knowledge and revealed the
   interdisciplinary nature of the sciences. For today's students, this
   advance translates to teaming a more diverse range of concepts, usually
   in less time, and without supporting resources. Students can benefit
   from technology-enhanced learning supplements that unify concepts and
   are delivered on-demand over the Internet. Such supplements, like
   imaging informatics databases, serve as innovative references for
   biomedical information, but could improve their interaction interfaces
   to support teaming. With information from these digital datasets,
   multimedia teaming tools can be designed to transform teaming into an
   active process where students can visualize relationships over time,
   interact with dynamic content, and immediately test their knowledge.
   This approach bridges knowledge gaps, fosters conceptual understanding,
   and builds problem-solving and critical thinking skills-all essential
   components to informatics training for science and medicine. Additional
   benefits include cost-free access and ease of dissemination over the
   Intemet or CD-ROM. However, current methods for the design of multimedia
   learning modules are not standardized and lack strong instructional
   design.
   Pressure from administrators at the top and students from the bottom are
   pushing faculty to use modern technology to address the teaming needs
   and expectations of contemporary students. Yet, faculty lack adequate
   support and training to adopt this new approach. So how can faculty
   learn to create educational multimedia materials for their students?
   This paper provides guidelines on best practices in educational
   multimedia design, derived from the Virtual Labs Project at Stanford
   University. The development of a multimedia module consists of five
   phases: (1) understand the teaming problem and the users needs; (2)
   design the content to harness the enabling technologies; (3) build
   multimedia materials with web style standards and human factors
   principles; (4) user testing; (5) Evaluate and improve design. (c) 2004

   databases, followed by (2) a re-engineering of the original software to
   develop an integrated database environment with improved methods for

   achieved by providing ail operational smart material handling system
   that could address public health and safety concern. This paper

   will then elaborate on the Information System (IS) designed for
   transferring the data collected from the shopfloor to
   intraorganisational data management systems.
   A multistage procedure to relate a novel idea to a fully operational
   smart conveyor system capable of storing, maintaining, and transferring
   product information into complex routings of a harsh food environment is
   described in detail. Integration of mechanical design, electronic
   architecture, and radio frequency (RF) identification equipment using
   the state-of-the-art factory control Programmable Logic Controllers
   (PLC) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) suite of
   software is discussed. Various hardware tests, destructive or simulated,
   conducted to ensure maximum conformity to industry standards, are
   described. Specific tests were applied to the control software and Data
   Management System (DBMS) to maintain the integrity of the tracking and
   traceability system.
   Although this paper and the technology developed are targeted for meat

Abstract = {{This paper aims to shed some new insights on the long-debated and both
   extensively and intensively explored relationship between market
   concentration and industry RTD intensity. In order to do so, this study
   develops, from a classic Dorfman-Steiner {[}1954] model of firm RTD, a
   model of industry RTD, where consumer preference over quality and price,
   RTD technology, and the joint distribution of firm-specific
   technological competence and market share jointly determine the level of
   industry RTD intensity. The joint distribution term, which reflects both
   the underlying distribution of firms-specific technological competence
   and the strength of its link with market share, suggests that the
   concentration-RTD relationship differs depending on the strength of the
   link or simply the appropriability of RTD in terms of market share: A
   positive relationship is predicted for low-appropriability industries,
   where market concentration supplements low RTD appropriability, while a
   negative or an inverted U-shaped relationship for high-appropriability
   industries. An empirical analysis of data, disaggregated at the
   five-digit SIC level, on RTD and market concentration of Korean
   manufacturing industries provides supportive evidence for the
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging technology enables industry to create products and services to
   fulfill previously unmet needs. Yet, the higher fixed costs and
   shrinking product life cycles associated with new digital technologies
   also generate business risk. While many companies engage in continuous
   innovation to maintain their market share, an innovation in itself does
   not guarantee success. Given these strategic shifts, traditional methods
   of segmentation are inadequate, especially in markets driven by flexible
   information and communication technologies (ICT). This study bridges
   this gap by examining existing innovation and market segmentation
   literature, proposing an integrative framework that incorporates
   knowledge from both, and validating this model through field research.
   Application of this integrative model can help service developers,
   facilitators and operators design, distribute and communicate new
   services to fulfill the needs of potential adopters. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mobile Internet connectivity is the fastest growing business in the
   telecommunications market because of the evolution of digital cellular,
   portable computing and personal communication technologies, and is
   playing a vital role in shaping the 21st century communications
   paradigms. In this scenario, the deployment of innovative wireless data
   networks, the integration with the Internet and the interworking between
   different wireless technologies. typically 2.5/3G cellular and Wireless
   LAN (WLAN), will be challenging objectives for competitive service
   providers. These factors. combined with the impact that mobile-related
   traffic may have on the fixed infrastructure. and the convergence of
   mobile and fixed services, drive towards a rationalization of the
   resource allocation and management procedures and make it urgent to
   address quality of service and traffic engineering for mobile data
   communications at the core transport level. The Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) technology is a versatile solution to address the above
   problems which delivers a unified control mechanism with connectionless
   multiprotocol capabilities. running over mixed media infrastructures,
   and defining evolutionary signalling mechanisms to support both quality
   of service (QoS) and traffic engineering to allow fine control of
   traffic flows in the network. The purpose of this paper is to show how
   MPLS technology can be employed to address all the required functions of
   tomorrow's converged wireless/wired networks, from initial IP-level
   authentication and session control to sophisticated resource
   reservation. traffic distribution, quality of service and policy

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results from the development and performance
   testing of a cost effective, energy efficient, multi-type air
   conditioner that connected five indoor units (evaporators) to one
   outdoor unit (condenser) with a digital scroll compressor. Instead of
   using inverter technology, which has a potential risk of harmonic
   current emissions, this study used a digital scroll compressor, which
   provided the variable refrigerant volumes. The measured results for this
   innovative design showed: (1) The relationship between the degree of
   opening of the electronic expansion valves (s) and the compressor output
   ratio (\%) could be represented by regression functions, which formed
   the basic parameters of the system control. (2) The developed system
   provided true zoning capability because it could run indoor units under
   part load conditions, therefore wasting little energy. The power
   consumption of the developed system was reduced from 100\% to 25\% when
   the full load was reduced to a partial load of 17\%, saving more than
   75\% of the work required using a conventional un-loading method. (3)
   The developed system has a broader range of capacity output (from 17\%
   to 100\%) than that of an AC variable frequency control system (from
   48\% to 104\%). The developed system cost 20\% less than a comparable
   system with an AC inverter. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   error of 0.5 mm, as well as to the description of the statue in terms of
   both polygonal and CAD models. Moreover, it helped the archaeologists to
   prove the new hypothesis of an alternative origin of the artwork and

Abstract = {{This paper presents the CITYCLUSTER project, a virtual-reality
   networking matrix, in a high-tech framework with original technological
   features, navigation, interactivity, graphic, and content style, in
   which multiple environments, ambiences, and cities, both real and
   imagined, can be hosted, coexist, and be interrelated within themselves
   through a common virtual territory. It can be interconnected by
   high-speed network, enabling remote participants to access, interact,
   and collaborate in shared environments and work together in a common
   virtual space over distance in real time. The framework can be expanded
   and modified in accordance with the digital environment to be
   incorporated. Meta-Net-Page, a virtual-reality collaborative networking
   tool, was designed and implemented ad hoc for CITYCLUSTER.
   ``From the Renaissance to the Megabyte Networking Age{''} is the first
   CITYCLUSTER virtual-reality networked application, which offers visitors
   a thrilling interactive journey, from the Renaissance to the Super
   Broadband Networking and Electronic Age. Florence represents the
   ``Renaissance Age,{''} Chicago the ``Gigabits Networking Age.{''} Each
   virtual city is inhabited by a group of avatars: David, Venus, and
   Machiavelli in Florence, and Mega, Giga, and Picasso in Chicago.
   The implementation of CITYCLUSTER has given rise to a range of
   technological challenges, which in turn have revealed innovative aspects
   and salient features relative to content management, the development of
   juxtaposed virtual environments, networking interactive techniques,
   avatar design, architecture, and virtual effects. A series of special
   features and enhancements have been added to the software Ygdrasil, to
   satisfy content and quality levels of interactivity. In consequence, the
   Ygdrasil system was further refined as software tools that aid the rapid
   and intuitive development of interactive virtual environments for
   artists and other nontechnical users.
   The CITYCLUSTER project is primarily designed to run in the CAVE and on
   the AGAVE (Access Grid Augmented Virtual Environment). It can run either
   locally or through remote networking in both SGIs and the Linux
   platform.}},

Title = {{Architecting gloCal (global-local), real-virtual incubator networks
   (G-RVINs) as catalysts and accelerators of entrepreneurship in

   practices from current development and business incubation practices}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurship is at the heart of sustainable, organic growth for most
   developed, as well as transitioning and developing economies and
   incubators have often served as catalysts and even accelerators of
   entrepreneurial clusters formation and growth.
   Our premise is that this may be more so in less developed economies
   where incubators can help bridge knowledge, digital, socio-political and
   even cultural divides and help increase the availability, awareness,
   accessibility and affordability of financial, human, intellectual, and
   even social capital, the key ingredients of entrepreneurial success.
   Incubation has recently experienced increased attention as a model of
   start-up facilitation. Venture capitalists see incubators as a means to
   diversify risky investment portfolios, while would-be entrepreneurs
   approach incubators for start-up support. Incubators are faced with the
   challenge and the opportunity of managing both investment risks, as well
   as entrepreneurial risks. As an indication of their usefulness, more
   than a thousand incubators have been established in the last few years
   based on a number of different incubation business models
   (not-for-profit, for-profit, public/private entity, etc.), which we
   categorize in five incubator archetypes: the university incubator, the
   independent commercial incubator, the regional business incubator, the
   company-internal incubator, and the virtual incubator.
   In this paper, we propose an overarching incubator model that
   synthesizes elements and best practices emanating from the five
   archetypes empirically identified and also incorporates substantially
   higher economies of scale and scope, as well as global and local
   (gloCal) knowledge arbitrage potential. This paper presents an
   architectural blueprint for designing a gloCal, real and virtual network
   of incubators (G-RVIN) as a knowledge and innovation infra-structure and
   infra-technology which would link entrepreneurs and micro-entrepreneurs
   with local, regional, and global networks of customers, suppliers and
   complementors and thus help not only bridge, but also leverage, the
   diverse divides (digital, knowledge. cultural. socio-political, etc.).
   The implications of this archetype of new ventures incubation for
   facilitating both venture business activity and broad-based economic
   development are discussed and early findings from pilot projects in
   central and eastern Europe are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Most of the voice- controlled systems sold are based in an expensive
   software pattern detection technology. We have developed a pure
   hardware-based system able to detect chains of letters and sounds to
   control house environment with light, temperature and door locking
   devices among others. This application is divided in 3 patts, one for
   sensing and transducing, other for pattern detection and a final stage
   for output generation. The first one is achieved roughly, using a letret
   microphone as the main sensing element. The second is a modular section
   in which we use PLLs, and simple circuitry to detect the letters.
   Finally the third involves power stages and signal generation for
   specific applications. Our application can be integrated to software
   systems to increase its visual appeal and interactivity with the user.
   The results gave us ideas to implement this kind of hardware interfaces
   in museums and augmented reality systems improved with computer graphics
   interfaces in which even if the low cost gain is lost, novelty and
   interactivity are surpassed. We have presented a new improve commercial
   system using analog and digital electronics to produce cheaper and
   innovative devices.}},

Abstract = {{Leading edge technology advancements have posed big challenges for the
   digital design flow. Designing multi-million gate ICs at aggressive
   cycletimes requires new design methodologies and innovative approaches.
   Hierarchical analysis is a key need to achieve these cycletime goals and
   gain capacity and runtime advantages in the design flow. Timing and
   crosstalk delay closure are iterative and hierarchical analysis gains
   significant cycletime in the overall closure process. In this paper, we
   present a complete solution for true hierarchical timing and crosstalk
   delay signoff The paper discusses challenging problems and caveats with
   hierarchical signoff and novel solutions to address them. We explore
   gaps in hierarchical STA and present the first structured solution for
   hierarchical signoff. The results show 2x-4x cycletime and memory
   savings using our hierarchical signoff analysis methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the application of a personal digital
   assistant (PDA) or pocket PC as an effective communication device to
   telemonitor levels of asthma triggering gases collected from a remote
   location under test to a workstation which has a personal computer (PC)
   running on Windows XP (R) as the operating system. The Bluetooth (R)
   features of the PDA are explored to transmit data collected by a Direct
   (TM) Sense Tox toxic gas monitor equipped with five toxic gas probes and
   one temperature sensor in real time, thereby making this telemonitoring
   system an innovative instrument in monitoring levels of asthma
   triggering gases in the Et Paso-border metropolitan region, a region in
   which asthma is highly prevalent especially in children. At the
   workstation or fixed location these readings are displayed using a
   custom made, user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed
   using software tools like action scripting with Macromedia (R) Flash
   (TM). The growing advancement in technology and ever diminishing sizes
   of handheld devices encouraged us to opt for this configuration.
   Moreover, the PDA and toxic gas monitor were also chosen for their light
   weight, portability, flexibility, low cost and data collection and
   transmission capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The innovative features of an advanced Radiology Information System
   (RIS) are presented in this paper. The interoperability of RIS with the

   two novel mechanisms {[}1]. The first one is the particular message
   handling system that is applied for the exchange of information,
   according to the Health Level Seven (HL7) protocol's specifications and
   serves the transfer of medical and administrative data among the RIS
   applications and data store unit. The same mechanism allows the secure
   and HL7-compatible interactions with the Hospital Information System
   (HIS) too. The second one implements the translation of information
   between the formats that HL7 and Digital Imaging and Communication in
   Medicine (DICOM) protocols specify, providing the communication between
   RIS and Picture and Archive Communication System (PACS). The whole
   structure ensures the automation of the every-day procedures that the
   `medical protocol' specifies and provides its services through a
   friendly and easy to manage graphical user interface.}},

   based on images. Common user authentication based on passwords has the
   main drawback of the human difficulty in recalling them. Images are
   instead easier to remember than passwords. Moreover, modem compression
   and transmission techniques make image exchange between different
   devices (e.g. mobile phones, personal digital assistants, laptops, and
   workstations) in heterogeneous networks practically feasible. In the
   proposed approach, images are coded using the emerging JPEG2000 standard
   and taking advantage of many of its features (e.g. image scalability,
   embedded bitstream, image tiling, and interactivity protocol). The
   described image based authentication is more secure than the common
   approach based on password.}},

Abstract = {{By 2015, according to Mark Pinto of Bell Labs, the microelectronics
   industry will be manufacturing 10 million silicon transistors per human

   implemented on single silicon chips, assuring low cost production and
   selling, and the birth of new market segments related in some manner to
   digital domains. An innovative area where we expect to report strong
   gains from the current and future development of IC technology is
   Ambient intelligence (AmI). This paper present an AmI framework designed
   to better support abstraction and scalability arising from the control
   processing, the communication activity and the service delivery in order
   to reach autonomy, independence and distribution of the computational

Abstract = {{An innovative full-field three-dimensional micro surface profilometer

   viewing the fact that conventional laser confocal measurement method not
   only easily encounters undesired irregular scattering problems being
   introduced by object's surface discontinuities, but also lack scanning
   efficiency due to its single-point type measurement, the newly developed
   profilometer deploys a DMD chip to project spatially encoded digital
   fringe patterns with dynamic light intensity control, onto the object to
   obtain excellent measurement performance. A novel digital fringe pattern
   design with sinusoidal intensity modulation was developed for active
   confocal microscopy, to obtain optimized depth resolution with a
   micrometer lateral resolution. Some of important semiconductor
   components have been measured to attest the feasibility of the developed
   approach. The depth measurement resolution can reach better than 0.1 mu
   m and the maximal measured error was verified to be within 1\% of the
   vertical full-scale measurement range.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is a wellspring of growth (Romer, P.M. 1987). Although
   innovation itself is a continuous process for producing new ideas,
   productions, services and tools, conducting innovation is highly
   environment-dependent or plat form-dependent (Ping Lan, 2004). The rapid
   development of information technology forces environments to change at a
   great speed that also makes great changes to innovation itself in the
   digital-business environment. Given this background, this paper is an
   attempt at examining the great changes to innovation brought by
   information and technology, especially the Internet. Therefore, we put
   forward a new innovation platform: E-innovation. In this paper, we
   discuss the definition, management, application of E-innovation; we
   provide a five-D architectural framework of E-innovation; we also
   present an example on the application of E-innovation and drive
   recommendation for E-innovation based on research available.}},

Abstract = {{An innovative scheme for watermarking based on vector quantization (VQ),
   which is suitable for transmitting over noisy channels with multiple
   description coding (MDC), is proposed in this paper. Digital
   watermarking is one of the applicable tools that can be used to protect
   digital contents from illegal copying and distribution. In addition to
   conventional schemes that apply attacks on watermarked media, we focus
   our application on transmitting over noisy channels to consider both the
   error-resilient transmission of watermarked media, and the robustness of
   watermarking algorithm. By modifying multiple description vector
   quantization (MDVQ) algorithm for watermark embedding and extraction,
   simulation results not only demonstrate effective transmission of
   watermarked image, but reveal the robustness of extracted watermark.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of a real-lime image visualization system on a
   reconfigurable chip (FPGA) is proposed. The system utilizes an
   innovative stereoscopic image capture, processing and visualization
   technique. Implementation is done as a two stage process. In the first
   stage, the stereo pair is captured using two image sensors. The captured
   images are then synchronized and sent to the second stage for fusion. A
   controller module is developed, designed and placed on the FPGA for this
   purpose. the second stage is used for reconstruction and visualization
   of the 3D image. An innovative technique employing dual-processor
   architecture on the same single FPGA is developed for this purpose. The
   whole system is placed on a single PCB resulting in a fast processing
   lime and the ability to view 3D video in real-time. The system is
   simulated, implemented, and tested on real images. Results show that
   this system is a low cost solution for efficient 3D video visualization
   using a single chip.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectroscopy is a new method of surface image taking, providing
   simultaneously high position and spectral resolutions which allow one to
   make some conclusions about chemical compositions of the surfaces. For
   image taking advanced MCPs are currently used, sensitive in the spectral
   interval of 450-850 nm. One of the aims of this work is to extend the
   hyperspectrocpic method to the UV region of spectra: 185-280 nm. For
   this we have developed and successfully tested innovative 1D and 2D UV
   sealed photosensitive gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes. These
   detectors are superior MCPs due to the very low rate of noise pulses and
   thus due to the high signal to noise ratio. Other important features of
   these detectors are that they have excellent position resolutions - 30
   mu m in digital form, are vibration stable and are spark protected. The
   first results from the application of these detectors for spectroscopy,
   hyperspectroscopy and the flame detection are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This work has the aim to assess the influence of the Echograph
   Electrical Power (EEP) on the ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) behavior
   and the effect of UCA concentration on backscatter enhancement. In
   several studies there has been the tendency to use high UCA
   concentrations and high EEP, but this could limit the safety of the
   microbubbles. Here we show an investigation able to determine the effect
   on the backscatter intensity varying EEP and UCA concentrations. A new
   phospolipidic UCA and the last technological innovations in the field of
   signal processing and radiofrequency (RF) spectrum analysis were used in
   this study. Eighteen different saline-diluted UCA solutions were pumped
   into the vessel cavities of a new tissue-mimicking phantom and
   insonified at constant frequency varying EEP. The acquired RF data were
   digitally stored and off-line processed by algorithms ad hoc developed
   by means of a new software research package. The obtained results show
   that UCA backscatter can be considered independent by UCA concentration
   at high dilutions, while it is clearly influenced by incident acoustic
   pressure values in the whole tested dilution range.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a centralized digital PID control scheme is proposed for
   linear stochastic multivariable systems with input delay. The discrete
   linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach with pole placement is used to
   achieve satisfactory setpoint tracking with guaranteed closed-loop
   stability. In addition, the innovation form of Kalman gain is employed
   for stochastic disturbance regulation with no prior knowledge of noise
   properties. Compared with existing designs, the proposed scheme provides
   an optimal closed-loop design via the digitally implementable PIED
   controller for linear stochastic multivariable systems with input delay.
   Its effectiveness will be demonstrated by simulation study on a dry
   rotary cement kiln.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade Lithuania's economy has experienced a period of
   especially rapid change, which was influenced by different factors such
   as economic growth based on free market principles, substantial social
   differentiation and exclusion, negative demographic tendencies and
   Lithuania's integration into the international economic, cultural and
   educational sectors.
   An educated, competent workforce is the greatest asset and the most
   important prerequisite for further successful economic growth and
   competitiveness. Concern for universal access to education as well as
   the quality of education and a high level of competency is therefore
   essential. Although the social and cultural influence of education on
   national development is increasing, the education system in Lithuania is
   not yet fully able to prepare students and society as a whole for life
   and work in rapidly changing circumstances. Education and training
   systems must adapt to the new society development realities where
   ``lifelong learning is an essential policy for the development of
   citizenship, social cohesion and employment.{''}(1)
   eLeaming assists in redesigning of education system and opening it to
   the society. Related investment should improve the mobility, flexibility
   and skills of the workforce, making it capable of reacting to the
   changing demands in the labour market promote social, economic and
   territorial cohesion as well as supporting the new lead sectors in the
   economy. Although socioeconomic development as well as human and social
   resource potential opens new possibilities for development of eLeaming,
   barriers, or obstacles, delay or restrict progress to implement
   effective and widely accessible learning means. Those barriers arise in
   parts of the national educational system, in educational institutions or
   among individuals.
   Problems in macroeconomic context are related with relatively small
   education and vocational training market, relatively short distances
   between learners and training providers, digital divide between large
   cities and regions. eLearning obstacles resulting from education system
   are mostly related to the lack of knowledge brokerage, eLearning
   monitoring systems as well as strict divide among different education
   sectors.
   The barriers resulting from the rapid development of technology are
   mostly related with rapid ICT development that is very slow in
   adaptation to educational processes and technological complexity.
   Other significant obstacles are focused on legislation and
   legitimisation of innovation, educational organization, pedagogic and
   didactic principles, and last but not least misunderstandings due to
   imprecise terminology and miscommunication between specialists.
   Overcoming obstacles requires understanding of real demand and supply of
   eLearning services, education organizational structures and
   infrastructure, learning and teaching processes, quality assurance
   systems, and other eLearning factors. Only common efforts of education
   service providers, learners and the government could enable taking and
   utilizing the opportunities provided by eLearning that opens up
   education market for the whole society.
   This paper analyses the situation, barriers and opportunities of
   eLearning development in Lithuania with the focus on long run strategy
   towards universal access to education for all Lithuanian citizens.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes an innovative 3-D surface contouring approach for
   automatic and accurate free-form surface reconstruction using a sensor
   integration concept. The study addresses a critical problem in accurate
   measurement of free-form surfaces by developing an automatic
   reconstruction approach. Unacceptable measuring accuracy issues are
   mainly due to the errors arising from the use of inadequate measuring
   strategies, ending up with inaccurate digitised data and costly
   post-data processing in Reverse Engineering (RE). This article is thus
   aimed to develop automatic digitising strategies for ensuring surface
   reconstruction efficiency, as well as accuracy. The developed approach
   consists of two main stages, namely the rapid shape identification (RSI)
   and the automated laser scanning (ALS) for completing 3-D surface
   profilometry. This developed approach effectively utilises the
   advantages of on-line geometric information to evaluate the degree of
   satisfaction of user-defined digitising accuracy under a triangular
   topological patch. An industrial case study was used to attest the
   feasibility of the approach.}},

   broadcast outlets in several specialized news markets. Between 1994 and
   2003, GMS went from a phase of digital media experimentation undertaken
   by teams located within each existing newsroom, to the creation of a
   separate unit handling the online content of all print and broadcast
   newsrooms, to the ongoing integration of news production into a single
   newsroom per specialized market that generates different products for
   the various outlets in each market. This analysis illuminates how
   adopting online technologies has involved shifts in the locus of content
   creation in a path of increasing convergence in production processes but

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel digital control approach to achieve the
   unity power factor and fast output voltage regulation for single-stage
   single-switch ac-dc flyback power supplies. This intelligent digital
   approach achieves the combined benefits of high performance, low cost
   and high reliability in a single controller. In this solution, the power
   converter is constructed with the simplest and least expensive basic
   flyback topology that does not require a bulk capacitor to store energy
   on its primary-side. The converter operates in various modes according
   to the line input voltage and the output load. For power factor
   correction, there are two operation modes: critical discontinuous
   conduction mode (CDCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (I)CM). Two
   other operation modes apply to the output voltage regulation: fast
   transient mode during load transient and pulse frequency modulation
   (PFM) mode at light load. The IC incorporating these innovative
   solutions have been introduced by iWatt. In addition to describing this
   approach, this paper gives the experimental results obtained on a 90W
   (19.5V 4.62A) prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries received a grant from the
   Texas Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund Board to create the
   technical structure for a Web Portal to Texas History. In, collaboration
   with many stakeholders (Texas libraries, museums, teachers, historians,
   etc.), the portal to Texas history at UNT provides access to a diverse
   collection of published and unpublished resources (manuscripts, letters,
   maps, oral histories, photographs, etc.) to researchers, teachers, and
   young scholars at school, home, office, or anyplace with a computer and
   Internet connection. Implementing a state-wide system required the
   creation of a robust application framework for integrating heterogeneous
   digital information resources from institutions across the state. This
   paper discusses issues related to portal building and explores
   compliance and interoperability issues. Based on the UNT Libraries'
   Portal to Texas History project experiences, it will attempt to assess
   the current status and the emerging trends in innovative uses of portal
   technologies and provide an overall scenario. hi context of aggregating
   a variety of formats, bundling preservation metadata to facilitate
   long-term access, setting project standards and best practices

Abstract = {{Clinical Guidelines are a major tool for improving the quality of
   medical care. A major current research direction is automating the
   application of guidelines at the point of care. To support that
   automation, several requirements must be fulfilled, such as
   specification in a machine-interpretable format, and connection to an
   electronic patent record. We propose an innovative approach to guideline
   application, which capitalizes on our Digital electronic Guidelines
   Library (DeGeL). The DeGeL framework includes a new hybrid model for
   incremental specification of free-text guidelines, using several
   intermediate representations. The new approach was implemented, in the
   case of the Asbru guideline ontology, as the Spock system. Spock's
   hybrid application engine supports the application of guidelines
   represented at an intermediate format. Spock uses the IDAN mediator for
   answering complex queries referred to heterogeneous clinical data
   repositories. Spock was evaluated in a preliminary fashion by applying
   several guidelines to sample patient data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To review the challenges associated with ensuring the capture
   and preservation of and long-term access to government records and
   publications in the digital age and to describe how libraries and
   archives in Australia are responding to the challenge.
   Design/methodology/approach - Literature- and case-study-based
   conceptual analysis of what makes government online information so
   vulnerable and initiatives at the National Library of Australia and the
   National Archives of Australia.
   Findings - Democracy, governance, consultation and participation all
   depend on the availability of authentic and reliable information
   Government agencies as well as educational and research institutions are
   producing increasingly large volumes of information in digital formats
   only. While Australia has done more than most countries to date to
   address the need to identify, collect, store and preserve government
   publications and public records in digital formats, large amounts of
   information are still at risk of loss.
   Research limitations/implications - Focuses on circumstances and
   initiatives in the Australian Government.
   Practical implications - Librarians and archivists need to become more
   proactive in influencing the behaviour of government agencies to ensure
   that important evidence of democratic governance is created and managed
   in ways that facilitate their accessibility and long-term preservation.
   Originality/value - Emphasises the vital role that information
   management agencies such as libraries and archives have to play in
   supporting transparent and accountable governance in the digital age,
   and explores innovative strategies for ensuring the long-term
   preservation of this important documentary heritage material for the use
   of future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Our work presents an application of knowledge discovery technology aimed
   to help scientists in the detection of rare types of astrophysical
   objects. Our main idea is that while computer have the power to search
   huge amounts of data, an expert has the domain knowledge to efficiently
   lead this search. Our system builds upon two main components: a
   probabilistic model able to scale to large datasets and a set of modules
   to interact with the scientist. Here; we focus on the probabilistic
   model used to represent the joint uncertainty among the attributes of
   the objects registered in a sky survey catalog. This model consists of a
   combination of a Bayesian network and a set of Gaussian mixture models
   (GMMs) trained with an accelerated version of the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm. The model is currently being tested using
   data from the release 1 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The results
   indicate that the system is able to accurately detect a set of simulated
   rare objects, but it also provides a large number of false positives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces novel techniques for analyzing digital signal and
   modulation quality inside of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
   This convergence of innovations in logic analysis with those in vector
   signal analysis can provide designers of digital Baseband and IF signal
   processing systems as well as analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
   converters with the ability to make key measurements where they were
   previously unavailable or difficult to make.
   As FPGAs continue to make larger contributions in DSP for wireless and
   satellite communications, the increasing dominance of digital Baseband
   and IF signals presents a challenge to designers of radio and satellite
   systems. DSP circuit designers constantly make tradeoffs between design
   complexity (bit precision, number of filter taps, etc), power
   consumption, and signal quality. Key measurements like Error Vector
   Magnitude can be used to gauge the performance implications of these
   tradeoffs. Previously, vector signal analysis measurements have been
   either directly integrated into RF test instruments, or written as
   custom software by Baseband designers. With entire sections of a radio
   being implemented digitally, and integrated inside a single chip, new
   methods are needed to characterize the individual subsystems in a
   digital radio.
   This paper presents the combination of a dynamic FPGA probe, which
   enables routing of signal groups within an FPGA to a logic analyzer for
   measurement through a small number of physical package pads, with an
   FFT-based vector signal analysis software package. This combination
   provides simultaneous measurement of time domain, frequency spectrum,
   and modulation quality on digital signals inside an FPGA. It also
   provides the quick selection of various internal nets for signal
   analysis without time-consuming redesigns of the FPGA.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal recursive filters commonly used for fluoroscopic noise
   reduction blur moving objects and compromise device visibility. A motion
   discriminating temporal filter (MD-TF) has been developed for
   interventional applications on GE Innova Cardiovascular X-ray systems.
   This filter reduces motion-blur by detecting object motion and offers
   the potential for improved device visibility and/or dose savings. In
   this study, we quantified potential dose savings offered by the MD-TF
   using a realistic image synthesis model of the GE Innova digital flat
   panel system and visual perception experiments. The MD-TF applied to
   flat panel detector fluoroscopy images was found to offer up to 39\%
   dose savings compared to unfiltered images. In comparison, a simple
   image lag resulted in no dose savings.
   The results demonstrate the importance of optimal temporal filtering for
   maximizing device visibility, and for achieving maximum x-ray dose
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Breinan and Kear first reported fabrication of three-dimensional
   metallic components via layer by layer laser cladding in 1978 and
   subsequently a patent was issued to Brown et al. in 1982. Recently,
   various groups are working world wide on different types of layered
   manufacturing techniques for fabrication of near net shape metallic
   components. Integration of lasers with multi-axis presently available
   CNC machines, CAD/CAM, sensors and powder metal delivery through
   co-axial nozzles along with the laser beam are the main innovations for
   fabrication of 3-Dimensional components. Continuous corrective measures
   during the manufacturing process are necessary to fabricate net shape
   functional parts with close tolerances and acceptable residual stress.
   The closed loop Direct Metal Deposition(DMD) System, using an optical
   feedback loop along with a CNC working under the instructions from a
   CAD/CAM software, indicate that it can produce three dimensional
   components directly from the CAD data eliminating intermediate machining
   and reduces final machining considerably. This technology is now being
   commercialized.
   The closed loop DMD process ensure close dimensional tolerance and
   enables fabrication of components with multiple materials. A mold flow
   analysis revealed that an injection-molding die with conformal cooling
   and Copper heat sink can reduce the cycle time up to 50\% or more. DMD
   has already demonstrated the capability of fabricating 3-D 100\% dense
   metal components with functional design. Popular engineering alloys such
   as H13 and S7 tool steels, Stellite 21 and 6 Cobalt alloys, Nickel
   alloys such as Inconel 718 are already reported in the literature. DMD
   can be adapted directly to the digital data from CAD, MRI and X-ray
   tomography. Conceptually, DMD is capable of fabricating almost wide
   variety of metallic parts with internal features. This paper critically
   reviews the state of the art of DMD and also speculate how DMD may
   affect manufacturing technology in the future. Three areas appear to be
   most promising to the author are:
   1) Designed Materials: This capability can be utilized to create a new
   class of optimally ``Designed Materials{''} - a class of artificial
   materials with properties and functions, which do not exist now. In
   other words, a material system can be designed and fabricated for a
   chosen performance.
   2) Integrated Design and Manufacturing: Another potential impact of
   closed loop Direct Materials Deposition is integration of design and
   manufacturing. In the integrated approach, customer performance desire
   can be implemented during design concept stage to the manufacturing
   realization. This will not only reduce the lead-time for the concept to
   product but also will offer materials with properties and functions,
   which do not exist now.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Molecular genetic alterations characterize the
   development of human cancer. Recent advances in molecular genetic
   technology and the success of the human genome project have empowered
   investigators with new tools in dissecting the cancer genome for
   discovery of new cancer-associated genes. The purpose of this review is
   to highlight the emerging molecular genetic methodologies and summarize
   their principles, applications, and potential technical challenges. The
   critical issue in sample preparation and a strategy that combines
   different molecular techniques to facilitate the identification of novel
   cancer-associated genes will be discussed.
   Recent findings Digital karyotyping and array-based techniques including
   array comparative genomic hybridization and representational
   oligonucleotide microarray analysis have been recently developed to
   study the genomic landscape in human cancer. These innovations provide
   tools to quantitatively measure DNA copy number changes in cancer and to
   map those changes directly onto the human genome. Digital karyotyping is
   based on counting the sequence tags that are distributed in the human
   genome and thus, it provides a digital readout to precisely outline the
   amplified and deleted chromosomal regions. Array-based technologies, on
   the other hand, compare the content of cancer and reference genomes
   followed by localizing the amplified or deleted signals in chromosomal
   regions using an array hybridization technique. In addition, a
   high-throughput mutational analysis platform has been available for a
   large-scale mutational analysis by using an automated capillary
   sequencing device and sophisticated bioinformatic tools. A number of
   examples have demonstrated the promise of these new molecular genetic
   approaches in identifying several potential new oncogenes and tumor
   suppressors.
   Summary As compared with conventional cytogenetics methods, digital
   karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization, and
   representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis provide an
   unprecedented mapping resolution that allows a precise localization of
   the amplified and deleted chromosomal regions. These technologies can be
   combined with gene expression profiling and high-throughput mutational
   analysis to facilitate the search for new cancer-associated genes. It is
   expected that applying these new technologies will lead to discovery of
   a host of novel oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which will have a
   significant impact in our understanding of tumorigenesis and in the
   clinical management of cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Geological survey agencies are developing methods for government
   geological mapping in the post-paper map era. Surficial and bedrock maps
   are being digitized and reconciled, while multiple generations of
   legends are being made accessible in a categorized format. Regional
   three-dimensional (3-D) geological models that integrate soils and
   geology, surficial and bedrock geology, as well as onshore and offshore,
   are increasingly in demand as the information, technology, and protocols
   to build them progress. Applications such as regional groundwater
   modeling require digitizing, reconciliation and assembly of a digital
   elevation model, bathymetry, offshore geology, soils, surficial geology,
   public domain drillhole and geophysical data, bedrock maps and existing
   stratigraphic models typically expressed as structure contours. New
   stratigraphic modeling, particularly required for surficial
   unconsolidated deposits in many regions, requires information from cored
   holes logged by geologists, as well as geophysical surveys. These
   high-quality results are extrapolated laterally using drillhole data,
   commonly large quantities of water-well data of varying resolution and
   reliability. Much effort is required to adequately georeference the
   drillhole data, and to parse large numbers of unique lithological
   descriptions. Stratigraphic modeling methods ideally use all data and an
   approach that permits judgement in the acceptance or rejection of data,
   while interpolation and extrapolation are guided by genetic insights.
   Models are best captured as a grid of predicted stratigraphy profiles
   that convey expert opinion on interpolation and extrapolation from the
   data points. Reconciliation of mapping with that of neighbouring
   jurisdictions is a key step, as is balancing subjective definition of
   strata with more objective geostatistical approaches to characterizing
   the heterogeneous physical properties of the strata. Progress is readily
   achievable in undeformed strata, while deformed strata present far
   greater challenges. Increasingly, databases of observations and
   measurements are being retained alongside the interpreted model, and
   models are being assigned varying confidence levels, such that the
   result is seen not as an end but as a means for prioritizing new
   mapping. Current activity is broadening our reliance not only from paper
   maps to digital models, but also from plan view maps to drillhole
   databases, to 3-D models, to dynamic models such as groundwater flow
   models. Pressing user requirements demand that geological survey work
   advances rapidly along this progression.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-growing development of national digital geological cartographic
   systems emphasizes the need for standardization of geological mapping. A
   synthesis of the two existing approaches, which are of interest as
   starting points in the tremendous process of standardization of
   innovative geological mapping, is presented. A recent example of the US
   Geological Survey standardized geological information system for the
   production of stratigraphic maps is emphasized. A general conceptual
   model of the database content and structure is presented in brief,
   considering the main concepts related to standardization of geological
   mapping procedures and geological terminology. A second issue concerns
   traditional engineering geological mapping. Its importance lies in the
   abundance of engineering geological standards and recommendations, which
   could be directly applied to custom-oriented geological mapping.
   Therefore, the goal of analyses of engineering geological mapping is to
   extract the main issues of engineering geological mapping related to
   standardization of modem geological cartography. The main contribution
   of this paper is to address the extensions of digital geological
   cartographic databases with engineering geological data which are
   required for the production of a wide spectrum of geological
   custom-oriented maps from the same geological information system.}},

Abstract = {{The role of geology in ensuring environmental protection, sustainable
   resources and a safer environment is not widely understood. Not many
   people outside the geological profession can understand a conventional
   geological map and can comprehend what that map has to say about risks
   and resources; the fact that geological maps also reveal what is
   happening at depth-the third dimension-is appreciated by even fewer
   people. The information technology (IT) revolution has provided
   sophisticated new hardware and software-database, geographical
   information system (GIS) and three-dimensional (3-D) modelling
   packages-so that we no longer have to be restricted to producing one
   complex and highly scientific document as the result of our survey and
   research work. In the new IT datasets, however, products and services
   need special attribution and quality control. Providing full national
   cover with novel products and services, digitising legacy and map data
   causes many problems with ensuring consistency and thus the need to
   agree and work to standards. And, there arise problems of liability,
   intellectual property rights and charging policy when digital products
   become more widely available.}},

Abstract = {{Geological mapping is a specific research and exploration tool,
   indispensable in acquisition, storing, processing and presentation of
   information on continuously expanding list of geo-subjects, mainly:
   Geological structure of small and large areas;
   Geological resources and prospects of their development and utilization;
   Natural and men-caused hazards and their mitigation, protection of land
   and property to secure sustainability. Rules of basic geological mapping
   remain unchanged in the 21(st) century, but considerable development was
   made in the exploration, especially, of the habited areas. Different
   become requirements of potential users of geological maps. Due to
   electronic technologies, the acquisition, management, compilation and
   presentations of the mappable data are greatly improved. While digital
   technologies are bettering efficiency of geological mapping and
   disseminating of geological knowledge, the standardization is needed for
   maintaining the compatibility of various portions of that knowledge. In

Abstract = {{The paper presents an application of computer mapping methods to
   geothermal. The examples of maps and crossections are inserted which
   show the structure and geothermal conditions in north-west part of

   areas are located. Presented digital cartographic materials are the
   results of the data processing in which the professional software was
   used, mainly GeoGraphix Exploration System by Landmarc and Tecplot by
   Amtec Engineering. With the purpose of using that software and
   generating the new cartographic and geothermal materials, firstly the
   computer data base had been created. The paper explains some typical
   Polish problems in access to geological, geothermal, hydrogeological,
   hydrochemical, engineering and other information necessary for
   geothermal exploration. Finally the article shows an example of applying
   the computer software to calculations, evaluation of geothermal
   resources, mapping the results of calculations and defining the areas

Abstract = {{Conventional methods of numerical mapping (geographical information
   systems, GIS) are used widely to convert surface and subsurface
   geological maps into digital two-dimensional (2D) space, which can still
   be simply identified with a sheet of paper. Digital polygons, polylines
   and points represent geological information on intersectional surfaces
   (e.g. the terrain surface), without relief in most cases. This does not
   seem much different from traditional mapping. In general, conventional
   digital mapping deals only with the new technology of data acquisition,
   storage, processing and visualization. As in traditional mapping, the
   third dimension, which is so important for geologists, still remains
   hidden to the ordinary reader; one must interpret and penetrate the 2D
   map to imagine and understand subsurface structures. Should we, however,
   employ the third dimension, or even the fourth, in digital geological
   mapping? The computational power of modem hardware gives us the
   possibility to store, manage and visualize the voluminous and complex
   data necessary to present the 3D geological space. Recent industrial
   development presenting new techniques of computer modelling of spatial
   geological objects and processes can and may be applied in standard
   geological mapping.
   A 3D geological map of Poland is presented as an example of a product of
   multidimensional computer-based cartography. The map is still in the
   developmental stage and techniques of model construction and
   visualization are refined using numerical methods. A relatively large
   area of interest covering several different regional geological units is
   included in this model and it creates new challenges in 3D map
   production. The map is based on existing interpretations-archival,
   analogue subsurface geological maps, mainly on horizontal-section maps
   with a depth interval from -500 to -5000 in a.s.l. Data from drill holes
   and cross-country geological sections are also used as input to the
   model.
   A system of manipulation and visualization of 3D geological maps is
   proposed. The following topics are presented in the paper as features of
   the system: inclusion of 3D in GIS used in geological mapping (various
   techniques of geological data representation, intuitive visualization to
   display the multiplied, interbedded 3D objects in a form suitable for
   human perception and interpretation), 3D volumes (techniques of
   construction and visualization of 3D digital objects representing
   geological formations defined on stratigraphy, lithostratigraphy or
   lithology only) and faults (techniques of modelling and visualization of
   discontinuous tectonic structures in 3D).}},

Abstract = {{In the 90's, Geographic Information Systems started having a remarkable
   demand, since they are an innovative technology that allows visualizing
   information in a spatial way, along with its geographic distribution.,
   Digital maps enterprises offer a variety of services, among them stand
   out the ratification of addresses: to check clients' databases for
   detection and correction of wrong entries, and then to validate the
   integrity of every new record that is inserted. This work details the
   development of an algorithm that improves the process of ratification
   using spelling techniques, with the goal of minimizing the human
   intervention required in the process, without sacrificing quality. The
   benefits are better response times and reduction of service costs.}},

Abstract = {{Previous results have shown the potential of acoustic-to-seismic
   coupling with Laser Doppler Vibrometry for the detection of buried
   landmines. An important objective of the present technology is to
   improve the spatial resolution and the speed of the measurement. In this
   paper, MetroLaser reports on a whole-field digital vibrometer (WDV) that
   measures an entire one meter area with sub-centimeter spatial resolution
   in just a few seconds. The WDV is based on a dual-pulsed laser such that
   each pulse illuminates a one meter area on the ground, and the temporal
   separation between the two laser pulses can be adjusted to match the
   ground excitation frequency. By sweeping this excitation frequency, a
   displacement map of the ground at each frequency can be quickly
   generated. In addition, an innovative speckle repositioning strategy
   allows for movement of the measurement platform at reasonable speeds
   while still obtaining measurements with interferometric precision. This
   paper describes the WDV :instrument and presents preliminary
   experimental results obtained with this system.}},

Abstract = {{As part of its many functions, the reference library is charged with
   developing both its collection and its user community. These two
   functions are sometimes pursued as separate initiatives (with separate
   funding) by library managers. In Australia, the State Library of
   Queensland (SLQ) is committed to an exciting policy of simultaneous
   collection development and community engagement by integrating new media
   technologies with public programs. SLQ's Mobile Multimedia Laboratory is
   a purpose-designed portable digital creativity workshop which is made
   available to communities as a powerful platform to capture and
   disseminate local digital culture, and also to promote and train
   community members in information literacy. The Mobile Multimedia
   Laboratory facility operates in conjunction with SLQ's Queensland
   Stories project, an innovative portal for the display and promotion of
   community co-created multimedia. Together, the Mobile Multimedia
   Laboratory and the Queensland Stories initiatives allow SLQ to directly
   engage with existing and new communities, and also to increase its
   digital collection with community created content. Not only are both
   initiatives relatively cost-effective, they have a positive impact upon
   information literacy within the state.}},

Pages = {{1169-1187}},
Abstract = {{With advances in digital computer technology it is now possible to
   employ mathematical models to accelerate the innovation process in most
   industrial sectors. This article presents an illustration of this
   process to arrive at a new conceptual design for the traditional
   spray-drying process. Although not commonly recognized, there are some
   advantages to orienting the spray in a horizontal direction rather than
   the conventional vertical one. This requires the spray chamber to be
   redesigned completely without any prior guidance based on empirical data
   or observations. Here we have used a computational fluid dynamic model
   that has been validated with data for conventional vertical spray dyers
   to arrive at several conceptual designs of a horizontal spray dryer
   (HSD). Several stages in the evolution of the HSD design concept are
   presented and discussed. It is shown that use of a validated
   mathematical model can speed up the development process for an
   innovative product or process with very substantial savings in time,
   effort, and cost. This article presents simulation results for several
   spray chamber designs and points out the importance of the design of the
   air inlet and outlet arrangement for optimal efficiency and
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Representatives of the engineering and technology community, gathered in
   Tunis October 14-16, 2003 as part of the preparatory process for the
   World Summit on the Information Society, agreed on the following
   principles. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer
   enormous potential to generate and distribute wealth, but it is
   essential that the digital gap between the ``info rich{''} and the
   ``info poor{''} be closed. The World Summit on the Information Society
   is seen as a forum for debating the issues and advancing viable
   solutions by engaging the public/private sector in partnerships. The
   proven ability of innovation and research-development to find solutions
   to problems generated by the new Information Society is emphasised, but
   the development of technology must not be guided solely by profit.}},

Abstract = {{At the Kyoto University Center for Information and Multimedia Studies,
   progress is being made with TIDE (Trans-Pacific Interactive Distance
   Education), a distance learning project which links Kyoto University and
   UCLA in real time through cooperation between the University of
   California at Los Angeles's Digital Innovation Center and NTT. In this
   paper the authors report on a distance learning system that takes
   advantage of the TIDE project. During the creation of their system, the
   information exchanged among the lecture participants is first classified
   into five categories, then the function classes necessary to exchange
   the various types of information between the classroom and remote
   locations are assembled into six classes. As a result, 30 functional
   elements are needed for the distance learning system. In the system
   reported on in this paper, the authors classify the functional elements
   into eight subsystems based on network bandwidth and various
   restrictions. The authors also report on the technology requirements for
   each subsystem, in addition to the system structure. (C) 2005 Wiley

   personal digital assistant or (ii) a GSM SmartPhone. A novel innovative
   design enables direct control of the whole system by those smart devices
   with Bluetooth connectivity. The special software applications were
   developed for IPAQ PDA 5450 and Nokia 3650 SmartPhone for monitoring,
   parameter setting and exploiting all embedded functions of the novel
   smart pressure sensors with Bluetooth wireless inter-face (slave
   function). Another SW application for standard PC enables to process
   data in MS Office formats. This wireless system virtual port enables to
   configure the sensor, to sense and to record data by remote reading

   Joining the flexibility of distance learning with the interactivity and
   the intensive support of the traditional presential learning, this
   system permits to enlarge the delivered contents and learning efficiency
   of a basic and conceptual discipline. Further, a new evaluation and
   approval procedure is developed and applied This methodology permits to
   ensure that the approved student actually knows the entire transmitted
   knowledge and by using a new concept evaluation grade, it is possible to
   measure the difficulties of each student in passing through this
   learning process. This system could be applied with small changes in
   other knowledge areas.}},

Abstract = {{The digital-content market is urging better pricing and value-for-money
   for industry products and services. This is clearly evident in the
   recent price policies of majors. Production costs must be drastically
   reduced without affecting product quality. Content providers,
   aggregators and distributors constantly need to adopt innovative means
   of increasing efficiency in order to reduce cost. Possible solutions to
   this challenge could be found by automating, accelerating and
   restructuring production processes. AXMEDIS architecture and tools aim
   at reaching those results by: (i) reducing costs for content production
   with artificial intelligence algorithms for content composition,
   formatting, protection and workflow management, (ii) reducing
   distribution and integration costs, increasing accessibility, with a P2P
   platform at B2B level integrating content management systems and
   workflows, (iii) providing algorithms and tools for innovative and
   flexible Digital Rights Management, exploiting MPEG-21 and overcoming
   its limits, supporting several business and transactions models. AXMEDIS

Abstract = {{In the context of e-business, brand is a symbol to express product's
   functions and attributions, to counteract the negative impacts stemming
   from information asymmetry, and to improve marketing effectiveness. In
   addition a brand can also be served as a credit mechanism to win buyers'
   trust. The unique characteristics of the Internet produce very
   complicated impacts upon brands. On the one hand, Internet help brand
   owners facilitate their positive brand associations and improve their
   brand image; on the other hand, Internet to some extent reduces brands'
   influences. Products' digital attribute also play an important role in
   consumers' online purchase decisions. The rapid growth of Internet users
   and purchase power create both opportunities and challenges. To stay in
   the intensively competitive marketplace, enterprises should adjust and
   update their branding strategies by innovating branding concepts,
   achieving branding advantages, personalizing the brand associations,
   innovating products and services, and maintaining customer's brand

Abstract = {{Building geologically realistic reservoir models that honor well data
   and seismic-derived information remains a major challenge. Conventional
   variogram-based modeling techniques typically fail to capture complex
   geological structures while object-based techniques are usually limited
   by the amount of conditioning data. This paper presents new reservoir
   facies modeling tools that improve both model quality and efficiency
   relative to traditional geostatistical techniques.
   Multiple-Point Statistics simulation (MPS) is an innovative depositional
   facies modeling technique that uses conceptual geological models as
   training images to integrate geological information into reservoir
   models. Replacing the variogram with a training image allows MPS to
   capture complex spatial relationships between multiple facies, and model
   non-linear shapes such as sinuous channels. In addition, because MPS is
   not object-based, but still a pixel-based algorithm, MPS can account for
   very large numbers of wells, seismic data, facies proportion maps and
   curves, variable azimuth maps, and interpreted geobodies, reducing
   dramatically uncertainty in facies spatial distribution.
   Facies Distribution Modeling (FDM) is a new technique to generate facies
   probability cubes from user-digitized facies depocenter maps and
   cross-sections, well data, and vertical proportion curves. Facies
   probability cubes generated by FDM are used as soft constraints in
   geostatistical modeling. They are critical, especially in sparse well
   environments, to ensure that the spatial distribution of the simulated
   facies is consistent with the depositional facies interpretation of the
   field.
   A workflow combining MPS and FDM has been successfully used for the last
   two years to model prominent Chevron assets in both clastic and
   carbonate environments.}},

Abstract = {{Laser cutting of paper is widely used in the paper conversion industry.
   CO2 lasers are well suited for this type of applications. Desktop
   printing is a large market both for digital photography, document
   management and graphics applications, but it still lacks advanced
   cutting and scoring ability, and CO2 lasers seem costly to be integrated
   in mass-market printers.
   For that reason, mass-scalable and low-cost semiconductor laser diodes
   would be very advantageous to add paper cutting and scoring features in
   desktop printers. However, common paper can not be cut properly using
   visible or Near Infrared (NIR) laser diode since it has a very poor
   absorption at these wavelengths.
   We report here an innovative solution to achieve paper cutting or
   scoring using a 1 W single emitter NIR laser diode, within an inkjet
   printer. A special ink that absorbs the NIR light, and that penetrates
   all through the paper, is first disposed on the lines to be cut. Then,
   the laser diode goes along the lines to be cut. We show that a cutting
   speed of 2m/min can be achieved on 80g/m(2) conventional paper. The
   influence of the optical properties of the ink on the cutting speed are
   discussed, as well as focussing issues. In particular, we show that
   invisible inks are suitable, and very clear-cut edges can be obtained.
   The perspective of this technique are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews some of the requirements and proposed solutions for
   present and future space missions. Mobile Telecommunications at L and S
   bands require very large apertures and digital beam formers to generate
   multiple beams. New approaches are proposed for unfurlable reflectors
   and their feed systems.
   For navigation, the Galileosat dual-band array at L-band must provide
   isoflux on the Earth with a very accurate knowledge of antenna phase
   centre.
   Broadcasting at Ku-band remains a key application where flexibility in
   coverage pattern and channel allocation is a strong driver. New
   reconfigurable antennas are proposed to allow coverage and traffic
   flexibility.
   Two-way broadband multimedia broadband communications at Ka-band require
   affordable multiple beam antennas with wide beam scanning and low
   sidelobes. Both reflector and array solutions are being studied to
   replace the multiple reflectors with one feed per beam which are
   currently flown. Reconfigurable antennas with fade compensation are
   another challenging innovation.
   Low cost ground terminals are needed for all these applications with
   particularly challenging requirements for mobile users (Aircraft, ships,
   trains, cars, laptop users...). A breakthrough is still needed to make
   arrays affordable for the users.
   Future remote sensing missions will involve multi-band passive and
   active sensors from various orbits.
   At the low frequency end, P-Band Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) will
   require very large deployable apertures for which membrane solutions are
   being considered SAR at higher frequency will require more resolution
   and lower costs: reflector based SAR with multiple feeds and
   reflect-arrays are potential solutions under study.
   At millimetre-wave frequencies and higher, atmospheric sounding from low
   Earth orbit, and possibly from geostationary orbit, require innovative
   designs and solutions. Large scanning reflector systems as well as
   aperture synthesis schemes are being studied Science radio-astronomy
   missions also have very challenging requirements at these high
   frequencies, including extremely low levels for stray-light or sidelobes
   and detectors operating at close to 0 degrees K temperatures.
   The challenges and technologies outlined above will be discussed in the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines market acceptance for DMB services, one of the
   touted new business models in Korea's next-generation mobile
   communications service market, using diffusion of innovation as the
   theoretical framework. Market acceptance for DMB services was assessed
   by predicting the demand for the service using the Bass model. In our
   estimation of the Bass model, we derived the coefficient of innovation
   and coefficient of imitation, using actual diffusion data from the
   mobile telephone service market. The maximum number of subscribers was
   estimated based on the result of a survey on satellite DMB services.
   Following the obtained demand prediction models revealed that diffusion
   took place forming a classical S-curve. Meanwhile, satellite DMB
   services, reaching demand peak at 6 9 years after the launch, appeared
   likely to he diffused substantially faster than mobile phone service.
   This study, as an attempt to measure the market acceptance for the
   satellite DMB services, a leading next-generation mobile communications
   service product, using diffusion of innovation theories and based on the
   result of a survey conducted through one-to-one interviews. The authors
   of this paper believe that the theoretical framework elaborated in this
   study and its findings can be fruitfully reused in future attempts to
   predict demand for new mobile communications service products.}},

Abstract = {{Basically, there are two classes of approaches to the modelling of image
   degradation effects: a priori modelling and a posteriori modelling. In
   the former case, measurements are made on the physical imaging system,
   digitiser, and display to determine their response for an arbitrary
   image field. In some instances it will be possible to model the system
   response deterministically, while in other situation it will only be
   possible to determine the system response in a stochastic sense.
   Our approach of image restoration is based on an adapted version of the
   innovations algorithm. The input samples X-(1) of noisy versions of a
   given image X-0 is filtered using a binomial mask B-3 and a method based
   on PCA and shrinkage technique yielding to new samples X-(2), X-(3).
   Next, an approximation scheme for the matrix K(4, j) is developed and,
   according to the innovations algorithm, the estimation z((4)) is
   obtained. The reconstruction scheme is defined in terms of the
   estimation z((4)) and the samples X-(3), z((3)). A PCA based shrinkage
   method to noise removal is presented and an adapted version of the
   innovations algorithm in solving image restoration task together with
   the results of the performed tests are reported in the final section of
   the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Recent discoveries in Earth Sciences are mostly related to technologies
   allowing graphical representations of volumes. We present a way to
   produce mathematically and geometrically correct three-dimensional (3-D)
   geologic maps consisting of the volume and shape of all geologic
   features of a given area. The method is innovative in that it only uses
   surface information coming from the combination of a standard geologic
   map, a satellite image, and a Digital Elevation Model. It is based on a
   modeling algorithm that only uses surfaces calculated from scattered
   data points and that intersects them following a series of geologically
   sound rules. The major advantage. of using such technology is that it
   provides the user with a way to quantify geology. The case study chosen
   to illustrate the method is the Beirut and Antelias watersheds
   (Lebanon), areas with relatively simple geology. The 3-D visualization
   and cross-sections help in the understanding of the geometrical
   relationship between the different geologic features, allowing the
   characterization of potential aquifers and the quantification of water
   reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis in combination with fluorescence microscopy calls
   for innovative digital image measurement tools. We have developed a
   three-dimensional tool for segmenting and analyzing FISH stained
   telomeres in interphase nuclei. After deconvolution of the images, we
   segment the individual telomeres and measure a distribution parameter we
   call rho(T). This parameter describes if the telomeres are distributed
   in a sphere-like volume (rho(T) approximate to 1) or in a disk-like
   volume (rho(T) >> 1). Because of the statistical nature of this
   parameter, we have to correct for the fact that we do not have an
   infinite number of telomeres to calculate this parameter. In this study
   we show a way to do this correction. After sorting mouse lymphocytes and
   calculating rho(T) and using the correction introduced in this paper we
   show a significant difference between nuclei in G2 and nuclei in either
   G0/G1 or S phase. The mean values of rho(T) for G0/G1, S and G2 are
   1.03, 1.02 and 13 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an initiative for preserving Slovenian digital
   heritage via setting Slovenian national digital archive. We have
   proposed methodology for archiving electronic publications based on the
   already established theoretical models that we used for defining
   specific procedures and standards relying on traditional library
   practice in Slovenia. We have also designed an efficient system for
   collecting Web publications and a robust system for archiving digital
   content obtained either from the Web or from other sources of electronic
   publications. Both systems are based on the standard methodology and
   incorporate several innovative approaches. It is envisioned that the
   developed archive will be publicly used for searching the content via
   some Web browser, so the user interface of our system is similar to the
   interface of popular search engines. We found that it is crucial to have
   ail interdisciplinary learn of research in strong collaboration with
   good knowledge oil standards both from digital libraries as well as
   storing and analyzing textual data.}},

Pages = {{35-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of Net Neighbours, an online
   shopping scheme that widens internet access to older people via
   volunteer telephone intermediaries. It outlines the processes of:
   problem identification, designing the telephone interaction, the
   financial model and the interface for the volunteer. It describes the
   application and adaptation of human computer interaction (HCI)
   techniques to address the needs of the local charity that co-developed
   the scheme. The paper begins by reporting the ethnographic work that led
   to the scheme; it then describes the pilot study conducted with Age
   Concern, York. It maps the various possible configurations for the
   scheme in a series of financial models expressed in tree diagrams and
   goes on to describe the use of pastiche scenarios in developing designs.
   Pastiche scenarios draw on fiction as a resource to explore, in an
   engaging manner, the social issues raised by technological innovations;
   the paper presents extracts from three such scenarios that were used to
   reason about dependability issues with Age Concern staff. The scheme is
   ongoing and plans are currently being made to extend it by recruiting
   university staff and other office workers as volunteer intermediaries.
   It is hoped that the scheme will become widely available across the city
   and in other locations around the UK. It is argued that volunteer
   telephone intermediaries can bridge digital divides and make Internet
   services accessible to those excluded either by age, disability or lack
   of resources. The development of the scheme is a case study in the ways
   that HCI techniques can be adopted and adapted in order to design for
   civil society. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Computerized navigation surgery has evolved to facilitate minimally
   invasive procedures, the gold standard of surgery today. While flapless
   implant surgery may be clinically beneficial, it has generally been
   perceived as a blind procedure limited to straightforward cases that do
   not pose a risk of cortical plate perforation. The objective of this
   report is to describe a protocol for flapless implant placement in a
   completely edentulous mandible using computerized navigation surgery.
   The Image Guided Implantology system (IGI, DenX Advanced Dental Systems)
   is described. The IGI system provides real-time imaging of the dental
   drill and transforms flapless implant surgery into a fully monitored
   procedure. The highly accurate intraoperative navigation enables precise
   transfer of the detailed presurgical implant plan to the patient. This
   is particularly valuable in edentulous jaws lacking any indication of
   the dental arch. The accurate positioning of the implants, based on the
   presurgical digital plan, allows fabrication of a provisional fixed
   prosthesis before the implant surgery for immediate postoperative
   loading. This innovative protocol can enhance prosthodontic-driven
   placement of implants in a fully monitored flapless surgery.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, skill preservation of an expert has been a serious
   problem in the medical or production fields. If digital skill
   preservation like a bilateral database is attained, it may become an
   innovative solution of the above problem. In this paper, abstraction and
   reproduction methods of force sensation from the real environment by
   bilateral control, and reconstruction method of the real environment are
   proposed. In the abstraction mode, a master-slave system is composed and
   the law of action and reaction is attained by bilateral control. We
   succeeded in realization of a vivid sensation of touch for bilateral
   robot system. Force and position information of both of master and slave
   systems is calculated and obtained, being based on acceleration
   information. In the reconstruction mode, an environment model is
   reconstructed from the obtained data of the real environment In the
   reproduction mode, only the master system is prepared. Human operates
   the master system and reels force sensation from the environmental model
   which is reconstructed in the reconstruction mode. As a result, the
   proposed system is able to store the real environment as a bilateral
   database. The experimental results show the viability of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The surgeon's navigation during surgery becomes a major field of surgery
   intervention. In this paper a prototype of a new surgical navigation
   system is described. The focus of this paper includes the descriptions
   of the hardware and software for the guidance task of this imaged-guided
   optical surgical system, especially the localizer division. With the
   Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) sensors and digital cameras fixed
   on the probe, the system can overcome some disadvantages that the
   classic surgical navigation systems have. It is able to track the probe
   and the pathological area of a patient simultaneously and in real time
   during a surgery operation. The principles of the tracking process is
   innovative. The structure and characteristics of the navigating system
   are given in this paper
   The navigation method mentioned in this paper may also be used in other
   tracking or navigating fields, such as robot's sight, micro air vehicles
   navigation and so on.}},

Pages = {{114-123}},
Abstract = {{Defined as the differential degree to which rich and poor countries
   benefit from new information and communications technologies such as the
   Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by international
   institutions in terms of the number of persons with individual access to
   those technologies. Yet, while this measure makes sense in the rich
   countries, where individual ownership is widespread among the
   population, it makes very little sense in poor countries. For, in the
   latter, what we find is that although individual access is indeed very
   limited, a remarkable number of local innovations ensure that the
   benefits of the Internet are made available to at least 10 million
   people throughout the Third World. Many such persons are illiterate,
   unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing countries. These
   findings directly contradict the commonly held notion that there are
   few, if any, local innovations in the applications of the Internet
   outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer countries with
   close connections to the former (most typically through multinational
   corporations). From a policy point of view, we suggest that foreign aid
   donors and national governments pay less attention to providing
   individual access facilities such as so-called tele-centres and focus
   instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems devoted to
   finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the Internet.}},

   prepare nurse professionals who value and seek current information. An
   interdisciplinary team of nursing and library faculty, information
   technology and bookstore staff, students, and educational consultants
   developed this project. A pre-post and comparative group design of
   second-degree students in the accelerated and traditional baccalaureate
   nursing degree (BSN) options was used to examine students'
   information-seeking behaviors, and the effectiveness and cost of
   innovation strategies associated with incorporation of PDAs into
   students' clinical practice. Results of this study support PDAs as an
   effective student learning resource, especially for reference materials.
   The student group with PDAs had increasing numbers of questions
   associated with clinical situations and a greater recognition of the
   need to use current resources. Students made substantial use of their
   PDAs and health team members, while decreasing reliance on textbooks and
   clinical faculty. Students' use of and satisfaction with this technology
   is linked to access speed and readability. Providing faculty with PDAs
   is recommended to enhance their comfort with and incorporation of PDAs
   into clinical teaching.}},

   conceptual framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RETAILING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{125-140}},
Abstract = {{We present a conceptual framework that organizes current thinking
   regarding increased interactivity in the electronic marketplace and its
   implications for product migration. Product migration refers to the
   extent of reliance by buyers and sellers on the electronic marketplace
   for activities pertaining to information search, purchase, acquisition,
   use, and disposal of a product. We posit that value outcomes derived by
   buyers and sellers from increasing interactivity mediate the
   relationship between interactivity and product migration. The
   relationship between interactivity and value outcomes for buyers and
   sellers is moderated by three sets of product-related characteristics:
   the core characteristics of the product, its purchase and use-related
   characteristics, and market characteristics. Inertia and resistance
   exhibited by buyers and sellers negatively impact product migration to
   the electronic marketplace and also attenuate the impact of value
   outcomes on product migration. In addition to guiding theoretical and
   empirical work in this emerging area, the proposed framework can also be
   employed to structure a firm's strategic discussions related to the
   electronic marketplace. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by

Abstract = {{This article discusses the role of PANACEIA interactive TV (iTV) (IST
   2001-33369), which exploits the virtues and capabilities of both digital
   iTV and information technology (IT) in the field of healthcare, and even
   more specifically in the field of homecare and healthcare on demand (for
   monitoring and education applications). The purpose is to facilitate
   essential lifestyle changes and to promote compliance with appropriate
   scientifically-sound self-care recommendations. The means to achieve
   these goals requires major innovations and advances in diverse fields
   and it is based on technological, health services and business models.
   We evaluate the fundamental features of the suggested
   platform/infrastructure and analyse the innovative character of the
   system. Particular emphasis is given to the description of the core
   system architecture. Moreover, we explain and assess the development of
   specific digital TV services offered, especially for the delivery of the
   homecare environment.}},

   2004 address draws on the foundations of biology to provide a model that
   offers insights into the advent of electronic publications and choices
   for the future.
   Setting: The lecture sketches a picture of the fragile relationships
   found in complex ecosystems and illustrates how such interdependencies
   function in the environment of the coral reef.
   Analysis: Deriving lessons from the marine world, the lecture then
   shifts to a description of similarities in the realm of scholarly
   publishing, the impact of digital innovations in the marketplace, and
   the controversies and choices inherent in open access publications.
   Conclusions: Lessons from ecology and publishing lead to the conclusion
   that librarians must take action and risks in this time of dramatic
   environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{The most relevant phenomenon of this last decade in the field of
   semiconductor memories has been the explosive growth of the Flash memory
   market, driven by cellular phones and other types of electronic portable
   equipments (palm top, mobile PC, mp3 audio player, digital camera and so
   on). Moreover, in the coming years portable systems will ask even more
   non volatile memories either with high density and very high writing
   throughput for data storage application, or with fast random access for
   code execution in place. ne strong consolidated know-how (more than ten
   years of experience), the flexibility and the cost make the floating
   gate Flash Memory a largely utilized, well-consolidated and mature
   technology for most of the non-volatile memory application. Today Flash
   sales represent a considerable amount of the overall semiconductor
   market.
   Nowadays two of the several cell architecture proposed up to now can be
   considered as industry standard: the common ground NOR Flash that due to
   its versatility is addressing both the code and data storage segments
   and the NAND Flash, optimized for the data storage market. ne
   exploitation of the multilevel approach at each technology node allows
   the increase of the memory efficiency, about doubling the density at the
   same chip size, widening the application range and reducing the cost per
   bit.
   In this paper the main issues related to both NOR and NAND Flash memory
   technology will be summarized, with the aim of describing both the basic
   functionality of the memory cell and the main cell architecture today
   consolidated. Both cells are basically a floating-gate MOS transistor,
   programmed by channel hot electron (NOR) or by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling
   (NAND) and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunnel. The main reliability
   properties, charge retention and endurance, are presented, together with
   some comments on the basic physical mechanisms responsible for.
   A couple of innovative approaches to floating gate cell evolution,
   namely nanocrystal memory and 3-D cell will be described.
   Finally the Flash cell scaling issues will be covered, pointing out the
   main challenges. The Flash cell scaling has been demonstrated to be
   really possible and to be able to follow the Moore's law down to the 90
   nm technology generations. The technology development and the
   consolidated know-how are expected to sustain the scaling trend down to
   the 50 nm technology node and below as forecasted by the ITRS roadmap.}},

Abstract = {{This research develops an innovative free-form surface scanning system
   using laser triangulation for 3D dental data required for crown
   reconstruction. This novel design employs double laser diodes to produce
   two 45 degrees structured-light lines projecting onto the plaster tooth
   models and three CCD cameras to capture deformed fringes to achieve fast
   and accurate 3D surface measurement of plaster tooth models. Effective
   strategies were implemented to overcome problems such as potential
   measurement occlusion and data registration inaccuracy, commonly
   encountered by other data scanning methods. The developed system has
   distinctive features such as laser projecting angles for complete
   surface measurement coverage, digitizing accuracy, and compact scanner
   volume for potential applications on 3D surface digitization of tiny
   industrial components. Experimental results verified that the proposed
   system achieves a 20 mu m digitizing accuracy and possesses fast
   scanning capability. Maximum one minute is used for a single-tooth model
   and 30 minutes are used for scanning the whole jaw.}},

Abstract = {{The numerous merits of x-ray imagers based on active matrix, flat-panel
   array technology have led to their introduction in a wide variety of
   x-ray imaging applications. However, under certain conditions, the
   performance of direct and indirect detection AMFPIs is significantly
   limited by the relatively modest ratio of signal to noise provided by
   conventional systems. While substantial reduction in the additive noise
   of such systems is difficult, significant enhancement of signal can be
   achieved through the incorporation of an amplification circuit in each
   pixel. In addition, innovative photodiode structures can be incorporated
   into indirect detection designs to enhance optical signal collection
   efficiency. In this paper, an investigation of these strategies,
   involving the design, fabrication and performance evaluation of a
   variety of novel, small area, indirect detection arrays, is described.
   Each prototype array incorporates innovative features, such as
   continuous photodiodes and single-stage and dual-stage in-pixel
   amplifiers, that are designed to provide insight into promising avenues
   for achieving significant signal-to-noise enhancement. This information
   will assist in the realization of a next generation of highly-optimized
   AMFPI pixel architectures whose DQE performance will be limited only by
   x-ray noise and x-ray converter properties under a very wide range of
   conditions. In this paper, the design and operation of the present
   prototype arrays are described and initial performance results are
   reported. In addition, the benefits of significant improvements to the
   signal-to-noise properties of AMFPIs are illustrated through cascaded
   systems calculations of the DQE performance of hypothetical systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and fabrication of innovative
   phononic crystals integrated with two sets of interdigital (IDT)
   electrodes for frequency band selection of surface acoustic waves (SAW).
   The potential applications of this device include performance
   improvement of SAW microsensors, front-end components in RF circuitries,
   and directional receptions of high frequency acoustic waves. Analogous
   to the band-gap generated by photonic crystals, the phononic crystals,
   two dimensional repetitive structures composed of two different elastic
   materials, can prohibit the propagation of elastic waves with either
   specific incident angles or certain bandwidth. In this paper, the
   prohibited bandwidth has been verified by fabricating the phononic
   crystals between a micromachined SAW resonator and a receiver. Both the
   resonator and receiver are composed of IDT electrodes deposited and
   patterned on a thin piezoelectric layer. To confine the prohibited
   bandwidth on the order of hundred MHz, the diameter of the circular
   pores in phononic crystals is designed to be 6 micron and the aspect
   ratio of each pore is 3: 1. To maximize the power transduction from IDT
   electrodes to SAW, the spacing between two inter-digits is one-fourth
   the wavelength of SAW. Specifically, the spacing ranges from 3.4 microns
   to 9.0 microns, depending on the central frequency. Both surface and
   bulk micromachining are employed and integrated to fabricate the
   crystals as well as SAW resonator and receiver altogether. Firstly, a
   1.5-micron zinc oxide, which provides well-defined central frequency, is
   sputtered and patterned onto silicon substrate. Second, the IDT
   electrodes are evaporated and patterned by lift-off technique. Then the
   exposed silicon substrate is etched using DRIE to generate two
   dimensional phononic crystals. To tune the prohibited SAW bandwidth, the
   crystal pores are filled with copper or nickel by electroless plating.
   The insertion loss of the fabricated devices is characterized and is
   found to agree with simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{CASCADE (Patent Pending) is a new and innovative space-based capability
   for cost effective high bandwidth connectivity for military users.
   Analogous to a ``FedExT (TM)-in-the-Sky{''}, the Cascade System will
   deliver extremely large digital data files, nominally tens to hundreds
   of GBytes, to and from anywhere on Earth typically within a day using a
   single satellite and often much more rapidly.
   Small independent Low Earth Orbit (LEO)satellites will support composite
   1.4 Gb/s data transmission rates and Terabyte level on-board storage.
   These satellites will service individual data sources and sinks
   sequentially on a pre-scheduled basis to effect simple but timely `store
   and forward' movement of very large packages of data. Target users are
   those in remote areas that generate or require these substantial amounts
   of data but who do not have access to fiber or equivalent high bandwidth
   transmission.
   As a low cost solution for secure large volume batch data distribution,
   Cascade will free up over-subscribed real-time military satellite
   communications networks and provide near term, cost effective high
   bandwidth connectivity in support of information superiority and network
   centric warfare. It also solves the problem of prepositioning capacity
   to serve unpredictable surge needs. While Cascade is non real time its
   high data rate will deliver very large files ahead of slower; real time
   networks.
   A technically oriented overview of both the overall system that will
   provide the service and the nearer term Cascade technical demonstration
   will be presented. Potential military applications for Cascade will also
   be presented.}},

Abstract = {{Software programmable electronics for remote satellite tracking stations
   has been developed which can be controlled from a separate satellite
   operations center (SOC). This Telemetry Tracking and Commanding (TT\&C)
   and communications equipment provides a six times reduction in size over
   legacy equipment. The Pot-table Universal Ground Processing Unit (PUGPU)
   system supports the full set of telemetry, commanding, and ranging (TCR)
   ground processing functions. It has been developed as a Small Business
   Innovative Research (SBIR) project with RT Logic of Colorado under AF
   Research Laboratory's Information Grid Division in Rome, NY. The PUGPU
   is a compact design, housed in a half rack height enclosure enabling it
   to replace multiple 19 `' racks of equivalent functionality. The
   configuration supports uplink and downlink RF frequency conversion
   subsystem (FCS), direct S-/L-Band In-phase Quadrature (SLIQ) modulation
   and demodulation, digital baseband TCR processing (Telemetrix 70170 XL),
   and downlink spectrum monitoring and analysis (DSA). The system supports
   commercial applications developed by the Consultative Committee for
   Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and is AF Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)
   compatible, being approved for use by the US Air Force within the
   Automated Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS). A much fuller implementation
   of the CCSDS protocols is also addressed, including the Space Link
   Extensions (SLE) utilized within the Telemetrix 500GT for remotely
   interfacing the ground facility to the SOC via wide area networks. The
   PUGPU has been demonstrated acquiring NASA and DoD telemetry downlinks
   using both fixed parabolic and electronically scanned antennas (ESA).
   This paper will describe the components, capability and applications of
   this system.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence and widespread use of digital technology at all
   levels, from strategic bases and infrastructures down to the soldier on
   the ground, security of these systems and the networks that they connect
   to has taken on paramount importance. The past decade has seen
   widespread development, innovation, and growth within the DoD,
   Government, and commercial communities of Public Key lnfrastructure
   (PKI) to meet these security needs. PKI is a robust technology,
   supporting numerous applications, including user and computer
   authentication, secured communications, data encryption, and digital
   signature.
   As PKI technologies have moved from the laboratory and university into
   the mainstream, numerous operational issues have been realized that
   hamper their widespread adoption. These issues include: deployment and
   maintenance of Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructures; storage of
   digital certiticates on computer servers and workstations;
   transportation of certificates from computer to computer; replacement of
   lost credentials; and ``PKI-enabling `` of applications. A burgeoning
   industry has arisen to meet these challenges, producing an alphabet soup
   of products; many of which have competing and mutually exclusive
   capabilities, limitations, and supporting requirements.
   This paper examines, these problems, and proposes methods and techniques
   for the successful employment of PKI to support as wide a variety of
   end-user applications as possible. It discusses the following key
   engineering decisions that must be made, and best practices for making
   them: design of the CA infrastructure for maximum flexibility and vendor
   agnosticism; design of X.509 certificate templates to permit their
   proper selection and use for a wide variety of applications, including
   server security user and computer authentication, digital signature, and
   data encryption; storage of certificates on Hardware Security Modules
   (HSMs), smart cards, and removable tokens; and finally PKI-enabling of
   networks, and applications. Finally, it discusses ``gotchas{''} and
   issues that must be dealt with in the process of operational deployment
   of these technologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will examine the concept of an innovation spiral process in
   relationship to the mobile communications sector of the Information and
   Communications Technology (ICT) industry which is the product of
   convergence of the telecommunications and the information technology
   (IT) industries. The fundamental theoretical framework for the paper is
   that innovative applications prescribed by users of an adopted
   technology can be a significant driver of further product evolution
   which then can fuel further market innovation. New products that are
   spectacularly `successful' are those that give rise to this spiral of
   product innovation and market innovation. The paper will first review
   the macro perspective of this theoretical framework by analysing the
   spectacular success of the short message service (SMS) in the GSM
   digital mobile communications over the last twenty years from the
   product concept. This conceptual framework is then considered at a micro
   level to review three consecutive research projects by the authors over
   the last ten years. The broad aim of these projects was to better
   understand potential user adoption of new mobile telecommunications
   products. The first research project in the mid 1990's examined the
   barriers and enablers to the adoption of mobile phones by selected
   disadvantaged groups in society, in particular, people with
   disabilities. A modified focus group methodology based on interactive
   workshops was developed from this research project to gain insights into
   user innovation. This methodology was developed further in more recent
   research projects looking at the likely user take up of evolving
   multimedia capable mobile devices for innovative applications. The
   second study indicated that the market evolution of mobile internet like
   applications is likely to be very different from those developed for the
   fixed internet because of the different characteristics of the user
   groups. While the individual research projects have been published, this
   paper brings together the macro and micro perspectives of this
   innovation spiral to demonstrate the value of this theoretical framework
   for market forecasting for realising technology commercialisation. The
   research also has implications for the `form' of new high technology
   products and how they are marketed which places less emphasis on
   technical features but more on matching with user needs.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile commerce can be simply defined as conducting business activities
   over mobile terminals. It is the combination of electronic and mobile
   commerce performed over mobile terminals such as mobile phones, laptops,
   portable digital assistants (PDA), etc. Typical services include mobile
   banking, mobile shopping, mobile stock trading, mobile auction etc. It
   is widely regarded as an important innovation in creating more business
   opportunities and has a brighter future than its precedent - electronic
   commerce.
   With the development of mobile commerce, a new market of mobile commerce
   and its derivatives, such as mobile commerce terminal market, mobile
   network market, mobile equipment market, and mobile software market,
   comes into existence. However, since mobile commerce is still in its
   beginning there is a lot of uncertainty in its future. This uncertainty
   causes the emerging mobile commerce market to be in a dynamic and
   complicated state.
   How to develop a reliable model to explore this new market and examine
   the behavior of the market development is becoming increasingly
   important. This paper provides a framework which is practical in
   building confidence, namely the System Dynamics (SD) modeling of a
   mobile commerce market. System Dynamics modeling is a rigorous method
   for studying and managing complex systems. This framework is designed to
   enhance the model's reliability by combining some group process
   techniques, like workshops, group discussions, brainstorming, Delphi
   surveys, and fieldwork, with System Dynamics modeling. The mobile
   commerce market in this paper is regarded as a social economic system.
   The model-building process makes full use of group techniques so that
   the model can reasonably incorporate a wide variety of sources of
   knowledge including: system thinking, system dynamics, management
   science, mobile commerce, and marketing and hence the reliability is
   enhanced. The framework covers three stages of the model-building
   process: modeling, testing, and experimenting.
   In the modeling stage, the framework is aimed at developing a mental
   representation, identifying the Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) and the Stock
   Flow Diagram (SFD), with which a simulation model can be developed for
   the mobile commerce market. A CLD links variables that have causal
   interpretation and an SFD represents the structure of a target system
   with denotations of accumulation and flow rate. In this stage, mental
   representations are drawn in workshops attended by a group of
   researchers who elicit knowledge from experts by soliciting their
   judgments. Casual loop and stock flow diagrams are next developed and
   relationships between the variables are formalized using mathematical,
   logical and theoretical means and expert's opinion are solicited for
   justifying the models.
   In the testing stage, the aim is to test the robustness of the model
   developed. In addition to passing some common sense tests, the model has
   to pass several specific tests on some key parameters determined by the
   panel of researchers in order to examine the fitness of the model by
   comparing historical data with simulation results data. In the
   experimenting stage, the model is simulated to analyze the behavior of
   mobile commerce diffusion under different scenarios of national planning
   policies. As an illustration, a simulation model is empirically
   developed, calibrated and simulated for the Chinese market.
   In general, we found the framework to be useful for modeling mobile
   commerce diffusion in the Chinese mobile commerce market formation
   example.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, sheet metal forming and die development has been
   transformed to a science-based and technology-driven engineering and
   manufacturing enterprise from a tryout-based craft. Stamping CAE,
   especially the sheet metal forming simulation, as one of the core
   components in digital die making and digital stamping, has played a key
   role in this historical transition. The stamping simulation technology
   and its industrial applications have greatly impacted automotive sheet
   metal product design, die developments, die construction and tryout, and
   production stamping. The stamping CAE community has successfully
   resolved the traditional formability problems such as splits and
   wrinkles. The evolution of the stamping CAE technology and business
   demands opens even greater opportunities and challenges to stamping CAE
   community in the areas of (1) continuously improving simulation
   accuracy, drastically reducing simulation time-in-system, and improving
   operationalability (friendliness), (2) resolving those historically
   difficult-to-resolve problems such as dimensional quality problems
   (springback and twist) and surface quality problems (distortion and
   skid/impact lines), (3) resolving total manufacturability problems in
   line die operations including blanking, draw/redraw, trim/piercing, and
   flanging, and (4) overcoming new problems in forming new sheet materials
   with new forming techniques. In this article, the author first provides
   an overview of the stamping CAE technology adventures and achievements,
   and industrial applications in the past decade. Then the author presents
   a summary of increasing manufacturability needs from the formability to
   total quality and total manufacturability of sheet metal stampings.
   Finally, the paper outlines the new needs and trends for continuous
   improvements and innovations to meet increasing challenges in line die
   formability and quality requirements in automotive stamping.}},

Abstract = {{Laser cladding is an innovative surface treatment process which has
   several advantageous properties like a reduced material distortion
   compared to conventional techniques. In this technique the cladding
   material is fed as a powder through the laser beam to the melt pool. For
   an optimisation of this process with respect to treatment time and
   efficiency a characterisation of powder size, distribution and velocity
   is crucial.
   Holographic particle image velocimetry is a powerful tool for
   characterisation. of particle distributions with respect to size,
   3D-position and velocity. Due to the holographic recording principle
   3D-information can be evaluated from just one hologram. Its major
   drawback, the time-consuming development and repositioning of the
   hologram plates, can be avoided using the well-known technique of
   digital holography. In this case the hologram is recorded by a
   CCD-camera and reconstructed numerically.
   Common digital holographic particle measurements are performed using an
   inline configuration in order to minimise the experimental effort. In
   this case the measurements are limited to low-density particle fields
   due to increased noise generated by an overlap of real and virtual image
   in the reconstruction process.
   In this paper the application of off-axis digital holographic particle
   velocimetry to the characterisation of powder distributions in a laser
   cladding process is presented. Besides the experimental realisation
   special emphasis is given to the numerical reconstruction of the
   3D-position and velocity of the particles. In extensive tests the
   suitability of the proposed technique is demonstrated. In the powder
   measurements up to 300 particles are detected with diameters of about
   100 mu m and characterised with respect to position in a volume of about
   1cm(3) from just one hologram. In addition the speed of the particles is
   determined by double pulse measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Since the terrible events of 11 Sep 2001 the response to security
   vulnerabilities has been to throw ``Guns, Gates and Guards{''} at the
   problem. Three years later and it is clear that, although this may have
   had a short-term effect, it is unsustainable and unaffordable in the
   long term. The war on terrorism is going to be fought for a very long
   time. Defending against terrorism and enhancing the resilience and
   robustness of society and its processes now requires constant vigilance.
   Only technology can provide that vigilance at an efficiency that can
   provide certainty of detection and fast response. A technology led
   approach, integrating with people and their processes calls for
   innovation and a new generation of technology that fuses the physical
   world with the logical world. This approach is measurable in terms of
   capability and investment, in the way that the previous Newtonian
   security approach of cause and effect is not. This paper will address
   this new security environment and the different approach that R\&D has
   to take to ensure that life and Democracy thrive and terrorism is
   defeated.}},

Abstract = {{Digital holography has the potential to greatly extend holography's
   applications and move it from the lab into the field: a single CCD or
   other solid-state sensor can capture any number of holograms while
   numerical reconstruction within a computer eliminates the need for
   chemical processing and readily allows further processing and
   visualisation of the holographic image. The steady increase in sensor
   pixel count and resolution leads to the possibilities of larger sample
   volumes and of higher spatial resolution sampling, enabling the
   practical use of digital off-axis holography.
   However this increase in pixel count also drives a corresponding
   expansion of the computational effort needed to numerically reconstruct
   such holograms to an extent where the reconstruction process for a
   single depth slice takes significantly longer than the capture process
   for each single hologram. Grid computing - a recent innovation in
   largescale distributed processing - provides a convenient means of
   harnessing significant computing resources in an ad-hoc fashion that
   might match the field deployment of a holographic instrument.
   In this paper we consider the computational needs of digital holography
   and discuss the deployment of numerical reconstruction software over an
   existing Grid testbed. The analysis of marine organisms is used as an
   exemplar for work flow and job execution of in-line digital holography,}},

Abstract = {{Enhancements and innovations in microelectronics and multimedia
   processing technologies have made new services available and generated
   new video compression standards. H.264 is expected to replace the use of
   MPEG-1,2,4, H.323 in digital video systems. However, the complete
   migration is expected to take several years given the wide scale use of
   its predecessors. Moreover, applications like home surveillance and
   video teleconference require efficient, adaptive encoding and advanced
   techniques e.g. focusing on Regions of Interest (ROI). This creates the
   need for transcoding technologies and platforms. The high complexity of
   real-time transcoding can be overcome by utilizing a HW re-configurable

Abstract = {{In the last years, car designers have focused their design and project
   on the ``human factors{''}. A special attention has been given to car
   interiors in order to transmit to the passengers a feeling of comfort,
   safety and pleasure according to the brand and the history of the new
   car. For this purpose we have developed new design methods to evaluate
   the subjective characteristics of the car interiors, including the
   aesthetics. The main goal is to reduce the building of physical mock-ups
   for validating the final project also from a subjective point of view.
   Elasis researchers have developed an environment called ``AVE{''}
   (Automotive Virtual Environment) for virtual car interiors simulation.
   The most important component of the system is a parametric simulator
   integrated with Virtual Reality devices. The simulator allows to
   configure the main interior systems (driver seat, steering wheel,
   pedals, etc).
   It is possible to positionate the dashboard commands in the right
   position. In this way, the user can feel a complete immersion in the
   future car. All the virtual models have a realistic effect and behaviour
   that is configurable according to the user preferences and to the
   project requirements.
   Engineers and designers can prepare different solutions for the project
   and, thanks to clinic tests, they evaluate potential user judgments. The
   system allow to change physical (position, force feedback, etc.) and
   virtual (colours, materials, lights, etc.) parameters in real time so
   many alternative projects can be evaluate taking also in count eventual
   innovative proposals by users.
   In the paper, the authors show the main components of the system and the
   methods used in order to evaluate the car interiors. A special attention
   has been given to the subjective aspects of the problem so Elasis
   researchers work together with psychologists order to give the correct
   meaning to the obtained results.}},

   organizations in a high technology product market. In this paper,after
   the consideration of the innovation types in the current market, three
   factors are introduced to define the product innovation. After the
   development of three factors,two series of product innovation strategies
   for high and low level of innovative products in the current technology
   product market are defined. The introduced factors are level of change,
   speed of change, and scope of change. Furthermore, this paper examines
   that this result can be applied to the product positioning as a product
   development management in the case of innovative product market. Digital
   camera industry is selected as the sample market to apply this analysis
   and strategy.}},

   evolutionary process of technology, product and market of entrant
   enterprises so as to discuss their possible,access to high performance
   and rapid growth. In three case studies how companies proceeded with
   discontinuous technology and subsequent commercialization was
   investigated ex post. Based on literature and the analysis from the

Abstract = {{The MAGIC telescope is the largest gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov telescope
   in the world. It is operating since 2004 at the Roque de Los Muchachos
   observatory, La Palma, Canary islands. MAGIC-II is the upgrade of this
   project, consisting of a twin telescope frame with innovative features
   like new photon detectors to lower the threshold energy further, and an
   ultrafast signal sampling to reduce the effect of the diffuse night sky
   background. The new acquisition system is based upon a low power analog
   sampler (Domino Ring Sampler) with frequency ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 GHz
   and data are digitized with a 12 bits resolution ADC. The analog
   sampler, originally designed for the MEG experiment, has been
   successfully tested on site and showed a very good linearity and single
   photon discrimination capability. Data management is performed by 9U VME
   digital boards which handle the data compression and reformatting as
   well. Every board hosts 32 analog channels plus auxiliary digital
   signals for trigger and monitor purposes. For a 1 kHz trigger rate and a
   2 GHz frequency sampling, the data throughput can be as high as 100
   MBytes/s, thus being a challenge for modem data transmission and storage
   solutions. The data are transferred to PCI memory via Gbit optical links
   using the CERN S-link protocol and to the mass storage system consisting
   of a RAID system and tape minilibraries. The data acquisition system
   design and performance will be described in detail.}},

Abstract = {{In Nijmegen, a high school array is being constructed since 2001. The
   educational aim of this experiment is to have high school students
   participate in a true scientific undertaking. This Nijmegen Area High
   School Array (NAHSA) currently consists of eight stations located in a
   relatively compact area. This NAHSA initiative forms the seed of a
   national experiment called HiSPARC (High School Project on Astrophysical
   Research with Cosmics), which currently consists of five clusters of
   detector stations centered around scientific institutes in Amsterdam,
   Groningen, Leiden, Utrecht and Nijmegen. In 2004 HiSPARC won the
   international ALTRAN foundation for innovation award. Within HiSPARC,
   high school students build and operate the detector located at their
   high school and have full access to all the HiSPARC data through the
   internet. The data consists of the full digital scope traces of the
   signals from both scintillator detectors that make up a station. The
   setup of an individual station as well as the setup of a cluster will be
   discussed. The results from analysis, including energy estimates, of
   coincidences from two and three stations within the Nijmegen cluster
   will be presented, as well as the largest events we have recorded so far

Abstract = {{This paper describes the GEM and PRIME Projects. They address the
   existing skills gap at engineering and management level of extended
   companies and products. These skills are critical to fulfil the new jobs
   created to design, operate and maintain the advanced manufacturing
   operations fully automated and flexible and reconfigurable that will
   coexist with the mass production handled by outsourcing operations.
   The sustainability of present dynamic enterprise networks requires
   adequate strategies that are not sufficiently covered by existing
   education. Current curricula often tend to emphasize theory over process
   thus failing to meet the needs of the global manufacturing enterprises.
   This has led to industries that are poor at turning innovation into
   successful products and slow in taking full advantage of extended
   enterprises and products because they lack people with the right skills.
   We have gathered knowledge from the curricula being used by various
   Universities around the World in order to create a curriculum truly in
   line with the global industry needs which we have also surveyed in our
   project.
   The results of GEM are presented, namely the global endorsement of its
   curriculum, the creation of GEM ALLIANCE (Virtual University) and the
   PRIME Project to create the e-Learning contents.}},

   experience is supported in the Quality Management System of Higher
   Education Courses (QMSHEC) and the Educational Knowledge Process Model
   (EKPM) {[}5].
   In this paper, a course is an organizational entity (knowledge
   enterprise) with a life cycle supported in directional, primary and
   support processes. The life cycle covers the organizational and
   processes modelling (organizational structure), engineering processes
   (system and software design; and, curricular, pedagogy, standards and
   test design), production (software development; activities, tasks and
   practices development; mediation; virtual environment integration; and,
   verification and validation), Operation (operative proves, programming,
   execution, monitoring and closing), and, Maintain (Processes, services,
   products and technology quality improvement management).
   Under the principle: ``Everything written is doing and everything doing
   is written{''} this paper evidences the SPCE quality insurance meaning
   through the statistical results from the inputs, resources behaviour and
   products, pursuit in the life cycle processes (resources, students, and

   process for image sequences. The aimed application is digital
   restoration of old movies, and particularly scratch removal, which still
   remains an unsolved problem. Most of the current correction methods act
   frame by frame and fail to preserve the temporal coherences of the
   processed movies. Our new scratch concealment algorithm extends the
   recently published exemplar-based inpainting method by taking into
   account, for the block matching step, several images from the sequence.
   Furthermore, the method is improved by explicitely using motion
   estimation. A few results demonstrating the effect of this innovative
   extension are presented and compared to static methods.}},

Abstract = {{The Lisbon Initiative 2000 lays out a vision where Europe aims to become
   at the fore front of the Knowledge Society by 2010. The implementation
   action plan presents deep challenges to traditional manufacturing which
   need to embrace innovative practices and business models, duly supported
   by ICT tools, aiming towards more knowledge based and customized.
   production and systems organization, able to respond competitively to
   global demand, whilst ensuring that any company's most valuable asset,
   namely its people, is able to learn and share knowledge (e.g. {[}1]).
   In our research work, closely associated to the manufacturing
   communities, we have developed and applied effective methodologies to
   support their reorganisation and business processes enabled by new ICT
   tools that allows them to achieve sustainable competitiveness driven by
   an effective innovation culture. This work was developed in the context
   of three RTD projects: SMARTISAN (IST-2000-26267), SCOOP (IST2000-25200)

Abstract = {{Since the 1980s, in the province of Viterbo (north of Latium), a dieback
   of the hazelnut tree has caused progressive decay of the plants.
   Physiological, biochemical and molecular tests on bacterial strains,
   previously obtained from symptomatic samples of hazelnut branches, have
   shown some bacterial strains of the ``True Erwiniae{''} group or
   Pseudomonas avellanae Janse et al. involved in the etiology. In order to
   analyze the spatial distribution of the disease which affects hazelnut
   fields in this area and the relationships between different territorial
   compartments, a Global Positioning System (GPS) was set up to record the
   diseased plants, in association with the Geographic Information System
   (GIS) and spatial databases based on Mapinfo (TM), Arcview (TM) and
   ldriSi (TM) software. The hazelnut areas mainly affected by dieback
   disease began to be monitored from 2003 onwards and they have been
   correlated with historical data on the incidence of dieback over the
   last 6 years. Furthermore, data acquired in the ground activity was
   compared with the multiple layers of data supplied by the Latium Region
   and local Farmer's Associations (meteorological, geological,
   hydrographical and agronomical data, and land use) and analyzed by GIS
   software; digital maps were then been drawn. The results show a certain
   correlation between the incidence of the disease and some environmental
   parameters, such as rainfall, winter mean temperature and the elevation
   of fields. The infrared foliage emission was measured during the main
   phenological phases of the culture, using a portable spectroradiometer
   in the field, on both healthy plants and diseased ones, then from the
   air with an Advanced Spectroscopic Imaging System (A.Sp.I.S) assembled
   on an airplane. Some health plant indexes, such as Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) or Red Edge Mean Slope (REMS) were applied and
   tested.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, the market has known significant evolutions,
   characterized by a demand for innovation, higher quality, shorter
   time-to-market and lower costs. This tendency is still increasing today
   and companies are facing new challenges, while at the same time they
   have to manage the growing complexity of products and the difficulties
   of internationalization. These trends are even more crucial in the
   automotive market, where competition is ruling the system. The suppliers
   in this sector need to optimize their intern, but also extern
   collaborations {[}4, 5, 12, 17].
   Nowadays, new technologies help people work together in virtual
   environments, visualize Digital Mock-Ups (DMU) of products at the same
   time in different places using online conferences. Virtual environments
   allow development teams to communicate easier by exchanging product
   data. As a result, lots of unnecessary travels can be avoided and the
   collaboration can be improved, in terms of quality, contents and
   frequency.
   The goal of this paper is to present a current case study in the
   automotive industry. It focuses on the Product Creation Process (PCP) at
   Bosch. All the teams involved in the PCP are concerned by collaboration
   improvements: development teams, production teams but also, and it will
   be the centre of the study, sales teams. The improvement of the
   collaboration between salesmen and the other participants in the PCP
   inside Bosch, but also with customers is a key issue. The current
   situation has been analyzed, so as to prepare the elaboration of an
   improved collaboration process, with the objective to help the salesmen
   improve their communication with the customer, based on 3D models.
   After a short introduction, the paper tackles the issue of improving the
   collaboration between salesmen and other project members. The first
   section discusses the new technologies and methods which can be
   implemented. The second part details the elaboration of a new scenario
   related to a use case and its investigation in the sales process. The
   benefits brought by this work are presented in a third part. A
   presentation of the way to generalize this work constitutes the last
   part.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To detail a user's experiences of the digital archive project
   of the Royal Geographical Society (with the institute of British
   Geographers) (RGS-IBG). The ``Unlocking the Archives{''} project has
   five facets: construction and conservation at its London archives; an
   online catalogue of its collections; digitisation of images and maps;
   provision of online fact sheets such as historical time-lines; and an
   educational programme that conforms to the UK's national curriculum for
   secondary schools.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper explains how the RGS-IBG project
   has changed the way in which the study of the earth, the earth's
   history, and its historical sources, are selected, created, researched,
   taught, written, presented, and used. Emphasis is placed on two parts of
   the digitised archives: Mount Everest and its ascent, and encounters:
   images of empire.
   Findings - The two digitised archives described are not only innovative
   archival releases for worldwide dissemination but are also the basis for
   important educational projects. The RGS-IBG is the first UK learned
   society to provide digital availability and access for research,
   writing, and teaching.
   Practical implications - A very useful source of information and
   impartial advice for those planning to use digital archives or to
   digitise their own archives.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified
   information/resources need and offers a case study description of the
   Royal Geographical Society's ``Unlocking the Archive{''} project.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, simulated rockbursts using blasting have been carried out
   to assess the relative performance of bonded surface support systems
   (Espley et al. 2002, Archibald et al. 2003), study the response of
   rockbolts to dynamic loading (Haile et al. 2001, Tannant et al. 1994a,
   1994b and 1995) and for broad ground motion studies (Hagan et al. 2001).
   Two series of simulated rockbursts have been carried out at the Long
   Shaft mine near Kambalda, Western Australia, with a view to testing the
   in situ performance of four integrated ground support and reinforcement
   systems when subjected to strong ground motion. The experiments are part
   of a wider series of tests being undertaken by the Australian Centre for
   Geomechanics at a number of seismically active Western Australian
   underground mines, with the aim of testing the in situ performance of a
   number of standard and innovative ground support systems under strong
   dynamic loading conditions. The testing includes ground motion
   measurement with a 16 channel Impulse seismic monitoring system,
   three-dimensional photo grammetric imaging using the CSIRO developed
   Sirovision package, crack monitoring using a borehole camera, digital
   video camera filming and extensive manual measurements and mapping (Heal
   et al. 2004). This paper discusses the methodology involved in carrying
   out these simulated rockbursts and also presents the issues that will be
   addressed with the view to ultimately improve our understanding of
   ground support system performance under strong dynamic loading
   conditions. The preliminary results from testing at Long Shaft are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The presentation discusses a new concept and a paradigm shift in
   biological, chemical and explosive sensor system design and deployment.
   From large, heavy, centralized and expensive systems to distributed
   wireless sensor networks utilizing miniature platforms (nodes) that are
   lightweight, low cost and wirelessly connected. These new systems are
   possible due to the emergence and convergence of new innovative radio,
   imaging, networking and sensor technologies.
   Miniature integrated radio-sensor networks, is a technology whose time
   has come. These network systems are based on large numbers of
   distributed low cost and short-range wireless platforms that sense and
   process their environment and communicate data thru a network to a
   command center. The recent emergence of chemical and explosive sensor
   technology based on silicon nanostructures, coupled with the fast
   evolution of low-cost CMOS imagers, low power DSP engines and integrated
   radio chips, has created an opportunity to realize the vision of
   autonomous wireless networks. These threat detection networks will
   perform sophisticated analysis at the sensor node and convey alarm
   information up the command chain. Sensor networks of this type are
   expected to revolutionize the ability to detect and locate biological,
   chemical, or explosive threats. The ability to distribute large numbers
   of low-cost sensors over large areas enables these devices to be close
   to the targeted threats and therefore improve detection efficiencies and
   enable rapid counter responses. These sensor networks will be used for
   homeland security, shipping container monitoring, and other applications
   such as laboratory medical analysis, drug discovery, automotive,
   environmental and/or in-vivo monitoring.
   Avaak's system concept is to image a chromatic biological, chemical
   and/or explosive sensor utilizing a digital imager, analyze the images
   and distribute alarm or image data wirelessly through the network. All
   the imaging, processing and communications would take place within the
   miniature, low cost distributed sensor platforms.
   This concept however presents a significant challenge due to a
   combination and convergence of required new technologies, as mentioned
   above.
   Passive biological and chemical sensors with very high sensitivity and
   which require no assaying are in development using a technique to
   optically and chemically encode silicon wafers with tailored
   nanostructures. The silicon wafer is patterned with nano-structures
   designed to change colors ad patterns when exposed to the target
   analytes (TICS, TIMs, VOC).
   A small video camera detects the color and pattern changes on the
   sensor. To determine if an alarm condition is present, an on board DSP
   processor, using specialized image processing algorithms and statistical
   analysis, determines if color gradient changes occurred on the sensor
   array. These sensors can detect several agents simultaneously. This
   system is currently under development by Avaak, with funding from DARPA
   through an SBIR grant.}},

Abstract = {{Information and telecommunication technologies (ITT) are already tool
   economic development of society and their role will grow. The first task
   is providing of information security of ITT that is necessary for it
   distribution in ``information{''} society. The state policy of the
   leading world countries (USA, France, Japan, Great Britain and China) is
   focused on investment huge funds in innovative technologies development.
   Within the next 4-6 years the main fiber-optic transfer lines will have
   data transfer speed 40 Gbit/s, number of packed channels 60-200 that
   will provide effective data transfer speed 2,4-8 Tbit/s.
   Photonic-crystalline fibers will be promising base of new generation
   fiber-optic transfer lines. The market of information imaging devices
   and digital photo cameras will be grown in 3-5 times. Powerful lasers
   based on CO, and Nd:YAG will be actively used in transport machinery
   construction when producing aluminum constructions of light
   rolling-stock.
   Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will be base for energy saving and safety
   light sources used for vehicles and indoor lighting. For example, in the
   USA cost reducing for lighting will be 200 billion dollars.
   Implementation analysis of optic electronic photonic technologies (OPT)
   in ground and aerospace systems shows that they provide significant
   increasing of traffic safety, crew and passengers comfort with help of
   smart vehicles construction and non-contact dynamic monitoring both
   transport facilities (for example, wheel flanges) and condition of rail
   track (road surface), equipping vehicles with night vision equipment.
   Scientific-technical programs of JSC ``RZD{''} propose application of
   OPT in new generation systems: axle-box units for coaches and freight
   cars monitoring when they are moved, track condition analysis,
   mechanical stress and permanent way irregularity detection, monitoring
   geometric parameters of aerial contact wire, car truck, rail and wheel

Abstract = {{An accurate evaluation of daylight distribution through advanced
   fenestration systems (complex glazing, solar shading systems) requires
   the knowledge of their Bidirectional light Transmission (Reflection)
   Distribution Function BT(R)DF. An innovative equipment for the
   experimental assessment of these bi-directional functions has been
   developed, based on a digital imaging detection system. An extensive set
   of BTDF measurements was performed with this goniophotometer on Venetian
   blinds presenting curved slats with a mirror coating on the upper side.
   In this paper, the measured data are compared with ray-tracing results
   achieved with a virtual copy of the device, that was constructed with a
   commercial ray-tracing software. The model of the blind was created by
   implementing the measured reflection properties of the slats coatings in
   the ray-tracing calculations. These comparisons represent an original
   and objective validation methodology for detailed bi-directional
   properties for a complex system; the good agreement between the two
   methods, yet presenting very different parameters and assessment
   methodologies, places reliance both on the digital-imaging detection
   system and calibration, and on the potentiality of a flexible
   calculation method combining ray-tracing simulations with simple
   components measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge has been identified as a new and important factor of
   production. The governments of some Southeast Asian countries, Singapore
   and Malaysia in particular, have created their own development strategy
   on the basis of this idea. The transition towards a knowledge society,
   i.e. bridging the ``digital divide{''} between developing and industrial
   societies, has been attempted by heavy investment in ICT, the foundation
   of research institutes and universities and support for R\&D (research
   and development) in the private sector. Available indicators, like
   access to the internet, the proportion of scientists and engineers et al
   indicate that so far only Singapore has been able to close the knowledge
   gap through heavy immigration of high level manpower. An innovative
   epistemic culture is only possible through the development of a local
   knowledge architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The Universe Observation Center (in Catalan language, Centre
   d'Observacio de l'Univers, COU) is located in close proximity to the
   Montsec Astronomical Observatory (Observatori. Astronomic del Montsec,
   OAM), in eastern Catalonia (Spain). Both centers comprise the Montsec
   Astronomical Park (Parc Astronomic Montsec, PAM), managed by the
   Consorci del Montsec. Montsec Mountain remains the finest location for
   astronomical observation in Catalonia, as demonstrated by a site-testing
   campaign conducted by the Astronomy and Meteorology Department of the
   University of Barcelona.
   The COU consists of a Central Building (including a permanent exhibition
   and three classrooms possessing broadband Internet access), the
   Telescope Park (two astronomical domes equipped with medium-size
   telescopes, a coelostat for solar observation, and a portable telescope
   park), the Eye of Montsec (a digital planetarium and, at the same time,
   an extremely innovative platform for sky observation) and the Garden of
   the Universe (a tour of the land surrounding the COU: visiting several
   areas within it).
   The COU will offer to the Spanish academic community a, host of
   fascinating and unique activities in the fields of astronomy and
   geology. The Center is open not only to students (from primary school
   through university), but also to amateur astronomers, people interested
   in science and the general public.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology has become the driving force of innovation in
   many areas of technology and, in particular, in the form of embedded
   systems in vehicles. Embedded hardware/software systems control
   innovative functions in cars, support and assist the driver and realize
   new features for information and entertainment. A rapid development
   brought more and more digital hardware and software into a modern car
   only within little more than two decades. Systems and software
   engineering for embedded systems in vehicles is today one of the great
   scientific, methodological, and technical challenges. In modern cars we
   find all issues of software systems in a nutshell. This brings a wide
   spectrum of challenges for the automotive industry, including business,
   management, and technical issues. In the following we outline the main
   problems, research challenges and approaches to deal with them.}},

   three learning technologies (perceptual agents; collaborative
   workspaces; and digital libraries). Each has emerged and matured over
   the past decade and each has presented compelling and oftentimes moving
   opportunities to alter educational practice and to render learning more
   effective. The project seeks a novel way to blend these technologies and
   to create and test a new model for human-machine partnership in learning
   settings. The innovation we are prototyping in this project creates an
   applet-rich shared space whereby a pedagogical agent at each learner's
   station functions as an instructional assistant to the teacher or
   professor and tutor to the student. The platform is intended to open a
   series of new -- and instructionally potent -- interactive pathways.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the cost of digital cameras, the colorfilter array (CFA) is
   usually coated upon a single-chip image sensor. Each pixel of the image
   sensor can sense only one of the R, G and B colors under CFA. The two
   missing colors of a pixel are estimated using the CF4 interpolation
   algorithm. The interpolation algorithm may generate color distortion and
   degrade the quality of interpolated images. In this paper, we propose a
   new algorithm `'fuzzy logic and linear regression method (FLLRM){''} to
   solve this problem.
   We use fuzzy logic method based on the effect between pixels to avoid
   color distortion around the edges. The linear regression method is used
   to process the interaction effect among R, G and B channels. The
   proposed method can successfully eliminate false color, color moire,
   aliasing and color shifts in the full color camera output. Finally, we
   implement our method on the digital camera platform that is designed by
   Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). The processed image
   shows a very good quality, which also demonstrates our approach is a
   better CFA interpolation algorithm than the previous processed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Demands for miniaturized networked sensors that can be deployed in large
   quantities dictate that the packages be small and cost effective. In
   order to accomplish these objectives, system developers generally apply
   advanced packaging techniques to proven systems. A partnership of Nova
   Engineering and Tessera begins with a baseline of Nova's Unattended
   Ground Sensors (UGS) technology and utilizes Tessera's three-dimensional
   (3D) Chip-Scale Packaging (CSP), Multi-Chip Packaging (MCP), and
   System-in-Package (SIP) innovations to enable novel methods for
   fabricating compact, vertically integrated sensors utilizing digital,
   RF, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. These
   technologies, applied to a variety of sensors and integrated radio
   architectures, enable diverse multi-modal sensing networks with wireless
   communication capabilities. Sensors including imaging, accelerometers,
   acoustical, inertial measurement units, and gas and pressure sensors can
   be utilized. The greatest challenge to high density, multimodal sensor
   networks is the ability to test each component prior to integration,
   commonly called Known Good Die (KGD) testing. In addition, the mix of
   multi-sourcing and high technology magnifies the challenge of testing at
   the die level. Utilizing Tessera proprietary CSP, MCP, and SIP
   interconnection methods enables fully testable, low profile stacking to
   create multi-modal sensor radios with high yield.}},

Abstract = {{European foundries are competing against low costs countries, which are
   using different rules in terms of fiscals, socials and environments
   laws. These competitors are reducing the numbers and the proficiencies
   of new contracts, consequently modifying companies' financial balances.
   In order for the european companies to remain competitive, they need to
   convince new customers, by reducing their production costs; controlling
   the process risks and developing differentiation factors (quality,
   innovation, reactivity, etc.). The scientific way to amend the
   progresses is based on methodological propositions and deployments
   utilizing virtual and digital engineering technologies. Therefore, the
   bases of this paper are to propose methodological solutions for the
   integration of virtual engineering tools and methods all along the sand
   casting process, from the negotiations to the customer delivery. A new
   global approach is proposed, based on product and process definition,
   for costs evaluation, order strategic and logistic impact simulation,
   rapid product development, production performance enhancement and total
   digital traceability for parts and tooling. The fundaments and the
   innovative factors are explained, and the different new solutions that
   it has been necessary to create are argued, both on the conceptual and
   the operational levels. Finally, this approach relevance is demonstrated
   with a real case study, realized in SMC Colombier-Fontaine, the
   industrial partner of this project, where the application has been
   deployed and is working successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Digital watermarking is one of the useful solutions for digital rights
   management systems, and it is also a popular research topic in the last
   decade. However, most watermarking related literature focus on how to
   resist intentional attacks by applying benchmarks to watermarked media
   to estimate the effectiveness of the watermarking algorithm. Only a few
   papers concentrate on the error resilient transmission of watermarked
   media. In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm on vector
   quantization (VQ) based image watermarking, suitable for error-resilient
   transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating watermarking with
   multiple description coding (MDC), our proposed schemes for embedding
   multiple watermarks can efficiently overcome channel impairments while
   retaining the capability for copyright and ownership protection. In
   addition, we employ one optimization technique, called tabu search, to
   optimize both the watermarked image quality, and the robustness of the
   extracted watermarks. Simulations demonstrate the utility and
   practicability of our proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in multimedia consumer electronics, digital video and audio, aim
   to reach users through low-cost mobile devices connected to data
   broadcasting networks with limited bandwidth. An emergent broadcasting
   network is the digital audio broadcasting network (DAB) which provides
   CD quality audio transmission together with robustness and efficiency
   techniques to allow good quality reception in motion conditions. This
   paper focuses on the system-level evaluation of different architectural
   options to allow low bandwidth digital video reception over DAB, based
   on video compression techniques. Profiling and design space exploration
   techniques are applied over the ASP MPEG-4 decoder in order to find out
   the best HW/SW partition given the application and platform constraints.
   An innovative SystemC-based system-level design tool, called CASSE, is
   being used for modelling, exploration and evaluation of different ASP
   MPEG-4 decoder HW/SW partitions. System-level trade offs and
   quantitative data derived from this analysis are also presented in this
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular imaging techniques, such as catheter angiography, ultrasound,
   computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR), have all
   undergone unprecedented innovation and incredible technological leaps in
   the last 10 years. Ultrasound, CT, and MR have progressed in acquisition
   speed, resolution, and accuracy to the point that they have now
   supplanted the former mainstay, invasive catheter-based angiography,
   despite the advent of digitized angiographic image recording. This
   review explores the advantages and shortcomings of each technique and
   how they have changed the diagnosis and assessment of the cardiovascular
   system for endovascular intervention.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effectiveness of an innovative, classroom-based
   physical activity prevention program designed to integrate academic
   curriculum elements along with a physical activity program in providing
   moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. A convenience sample
   of three public school classrooms (one first, third, and fifth grade
   class) was observed implementing the TAKE 10! program while monitored by
   either CSA accelerometers or digital pedometers. Pedometer step counts
   and CSA data were recorded for each student and activity. As calculated
   from CSA data, average MET levels during the activities were 5.72-7.05
   (first grade), 5.51-6.77 (third grade), and 4.98-7.19 (fifth grade), and
   levels were not different between grades (p > 0.05). Average caloric
   expenditure (Kcal) per 10-minute session was 25.6- 27.8 (first grade),
   27.6-33.9 (third grade), and 29.7-42.9 (fifth grade). Measured pedometer
   step counts per session ranged from 644-931 in first grade, 659-1,376 in
   third grade, and 1,002- 1,041 in fifth grade. TAKE 10! sessions for all
   three grades produced exercise levels in the moderate intensity range
   throughout full duration of the session. Classroom-based physical
   activity promotion provides a useful strategy to promote meaningful
   physical activity among school children.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automatic road extraction technique that combines
   information from aerial photos and laser scanning data (LSD). This
   innovative Road Extraction Assisted by Laser (REAL) can detect the road
   edges shadowed by surrounding high objects. A new concept of Associated
   Road Line (ARL) graph from LSD is introduced to enhance Real Road Line
   (RRL) graph from aerial photos. The extraction process consists of three
   steps: The first step is analysing laser images where parameters such as
   height and edges of high objects are obtained. Secondly, digital images
   are analysed where road edges are detected. It is evident that ARL and
   RRL graphs are homeomorphous which provides a theoretical foundation of
   REAL. The gaps of RRL are bridged through their ARL with a topological
   transformation. Finally, shadowed parts of RRL are reconstructed by a
   spline-approximation algorithm. The experimental results show that this
   approach is effective and has potential advantages.}},

Abstract = {{I present evidence to suggest that an important share of the apparent
   geographic localization of spillovers from industrial RID may be an
   artifact of other agglomerative forces. A production-function framework
   is used to examine the role of geographic and technological proximity
   for interfirm spillovers from RID in SIC 35. Spillovers among firms
   within narrow, four-digit industrial classifications are generally
   stronger than those identified within the broader three-digit class.
   Such spillovers, however do not appear to be attenuated by distance.
   Geographic distance does appear to attenuate spillovers that cross
   four-digit boundaries, suggesting that they may play a role in the
   formation of diverse (but not too diverse) industrial agglomerations.}},

Abstract = {{Banta Digital Group (BDG) is a pre media company needing to fill a void
   in the market it serves. This need could be met by an application that
   consisted of software and database development. A problem arose due to
   two conditions. First, the company was late getting to the market with
   this product. Second, the company did not have dedicated resources to
   work on this project. BDG needed to adopt a solution that comprised of
   outsourcing and strategic alliances to fill this market need. The study
   reports how the company selected and managed strategic alliances through
   the creation of a virtual team. It also reviews details of the new
   business operating system instituted to foster an environment for
   further product and process innovation. Finally, the proposed approach
   used in this unique type of product development is described, which is
   also applicable in many business situations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Emergency department (ED) patient care relies heavily on radiologic
   imaging. As advances in technologic innovation continue to present
   opportunities to streamline and simplify the delivery of care, emergency
   medicine (EM) practitioners face the challenge of transitioning from a
   system of primarily film-based radiography to one that utilizes
   digitized images. The move to digital radiology can result in enhanced
   quality of patient care, reduction of errors, and increased ED
   efficiency; however, making this transition will necessarily involve
   changes in EM practice. As the technology evolves, digital radiology
   will gradually become ingrained into everyday practice because of these
   and other notable benefits; however, EM practitioners will need to
   overcome several challenges to make the transition smoothly and consider
   the potential impacts that this change will have on ED workflow. The
   authors discuss the benefits, challenges, and other operational
   considerations involved with the ED implementation of digital radiology
   and close by presenting guiding principles for current and future users.
   Despite the unresolved issues, digital radiology will mature as a
   technology and improve EM practice, making it one of the great
   information technology advances in EM.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous developments in digital imaging technology have contributed
   to the vital role held today by digital X-ray imaging in the cardiac
   catheterization laboratory. Foremost among these developments is the
   replacement of cine film with digital data equivalents as the procedure
   record. Other improvements include software innovations and processing
   algorithms, along with new types of hardware capable of delivering
   required functionality more rapidly. A significant recent development is
   that of the flat-panel X-ray detector as a replacement for the image
   intensifier, which has served the needs of the cardiac catheterization
   laboratory for nearly 5 decades. Clinical users must evaluate the
   respective technologies and determine whether one or the other meets the
   needs of their own laboratories. In this review, the two competing
   detector technologies are reviewed and a summary of general advantages
   and disadvantages of each is provided. A qualitative description is
   provided of parameters that can be used to assess quantitatively the
   performance of detectors and imaging systems. Using such objective
   measurements, together with standard techniques for evaluating imaging
   systems, angiographers and managers can better arrive at informed
   decisions for their own situation. Catheter Cardiovasc Interv

Abstract = {{Objective: To provide the first update of the EAU guidelines on
   assessment, therapy and follow-up of men with lower urinary tract
   symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).
   Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted based on the
   results of a MEDLINE(R) search concentrating on the years 1999-2003. In
   combination with expert opinions recommendations were made on the
   usefulness of diagnostic tests, therapeutic options and follow-up.
   Results: During initial assessment the following tests are recommended:
   medical history, physical examination including digital-rectal
   examination, International Prostate Symptom Score, urinalysis, serum
   creatinine and prostate specific antigen measurement, uroflowmetry and
   post-void residual volume. All other tests are optional or not
   recommended. Aim of treatment is to improve LUTS and quality of life and
   to prevent severe BPE-related complications. Development of a
   5alpha-reductase type I and II inhibitor and the data of the MTOPS trial
   providing scientific evidence for a combination therapy were the most
   significant innovations since the first version. Finally a more detailed
   knowledge on the natural history with identification of several risk
   factors for progression is the basis for a risk-profile orientated
   (preventive) therapy.
   Conclusions: Updated recommendations for assessment, treatment, and
   follow-up of patients with LUTS due to BPO are presented. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Purpose: A procedure for 3-D analysis of the internal fit of fixed
   restorations has been developed. This study tested this method for
   investigating the fit of all-ceramic crowns. Materials and Methods:
   Twelve data sets of a prepared maxillary canine were acquired by direct
   digitizing of the metal master die (CEREC 3 camera) and by digitizing
   gypsum dies after conventional impression taking (CEREC 3 scan),
   respectively. Using these data sets, 24 all-ceramic single crowns each
   were machined out of two glass-ceramics. The method is based on
   duplicated gypsum dies of the metal master, which were made for each
   crown. The space between the duplicate die and the internal surface of
   the respective crown was filled with a low-viscosity addition silicone.
   These silicone films (replicas) and their corresponding dies were
   digitized in the same measuring position. The internal fit was
   calculated and quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Results: The
   mean and maximum positive deviations were 348 mum and 986 mum (camera),
   respectively, and 294 mum and 830 mum (scan), respectively, for
   Vitablocs Mk II and 332 mum and 920 mum (camera), respectively, and 307
   mum and 852 mum (scan), respectively, for ProCAD. For both systems, the
   deviations were highest at the edges. CEREC scan yielded significantly
   better internal fit accuracy compared to the CEREC camera. Conclusion:
   Evaluation of the internal 3-D fit using the innovative method proved to
   be suitable. Indirect data acquisition using impression taking showed
   improved internal fit compared with the direct procedure. However, the
   differences between the data-acquisition techniques are small compared
   to their absolute values.}},

Abstract = {{Power generation and energy storage devices are essential components of
   the operational capabilities of the modern U. S. military. They are
   paramount to the tactical performance of advanced electronic systems
   such as Night Vision Goggles, GPS systems, and loser target designators.
   The modern ``digitized{''} U.S. military relies extensively on these
   electronic technologies and others as they are fully integrated into
   combat environments. However, the demand for these electronic systems,
   as well as new tactical capabilities, is outpacing the supply of
   available power and energy devices. Recent studies from Iraq show that
   standard military power and energy systems, such as generators and
   batteries, were in high demand but short supply which often limited
   operational speed and capabilities. In an effort to improve upon
   existing military v power generation and energy storage devices, the
   Army's Research. Development, and Engineering Centers (RDECs) are
   evaluating innovative technologies such as fuel cells for military
   applications. A variety of programs at the U.S. ARMY
   Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center
   (CERDEC) Fuel Cell lab are serving to fill the power and energy gap for
   soldier-based platforms. CERDEC serves as a test. evaluation, and
   program management center focused on transitioning integrated systems
   front the tabs to the users. CERDEC has adopted a ``systems of
   systems{''} approach to the development and testing of military fuel
   cell units and strives to develop completely packaged systems in order
   to rapidly transition fuel cell technology into the field. This paper
   will address current Army Communications-Electronics Research
   Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) fuel cell technology programs
   and their adaptation into military environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, innovative investigation of the flame dynamics of an
   industrial gas turbine combustor using high-speed imaging and flame
   luminosity measurement has been reported. Both digital and optical
   integration methods have been applied to study the flame dynamics of an
   unstable combustion mode, which has a fixed peak frequency around 105
   Hz. It is found that the light emission of the seeded combustion
   possesses the same dominant peak frequency as the acoustic emission. On
   the other hand the natural flame light emission failed to match the
   spectrum of the acoustic emission due to signal drop-out, which is a
   common problem for direct imaging of unseeded flame. The paper has
   demonstrated that the transition from stable to unstable combustion
   could be captured successfully by high-speed imaging using a pre-trigger
   mode. Three stages of transition from stable combustion mode to unstable
   mode have been identified. In stage one, the flame luminosity and
   fluctuation increased gradually, which could be assumed as the
   incipiency of the instability. In stage two, there was a sudden and
   sharp burst in flame luminosity, which indicates that the combustion
   process was becoming very intense in the middle of transition. In the
   third stage, the drastic flame luminosity dissipated slightly and
   oscillated with constant amplitude and the combustion locked to unstable
   combustion mode. The two applied techniques have been cross-checked with
   reference to the unique peak frequency observed.}},

Abstract = {{The Tansen Community Multimedia Center (CMC) initiative is part of a
   regional innovation and research project initiated by UNESCO to study
   the potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for
   poverty reduction. The project is looking for ways in which ICTs can be
   used to empower and strengthen the voices of the poor.
   Community multimedia centers are an extension of UNESCO's long-standing
   work with community radio, inspired by the increasingly important role
   played by new digital technologies. Community multimedia centers like
   the one in Tansen, Palpa District, Nepal, combine traditional community
   media-in Tansen's case, video, cable TV, and print-with new media tools
   such as computers and the Internet. The goal is to explore ways in which
   Tansen can use ICTs as dynamic development tools: to bring more voices,
   cultural forms, ideas, and issues into the community's media space, and
   to provide poor marginalized youth with new skills and opportunities.
   The combination of established local media such as community TV with new
   technologies like the Internet opens up great possibilities to link
   small, comparatively inaccessible towns and villages such as Tansen to
   new global networks. New media are not only powerful tools for producing
   content, they are also gateways to ever-expanding information and
   knowledge resources.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical concentration, entrepreneurship and regional growth:
   evidence from regional data in Sweden, 1975-99, Regional Studies 38,
   929-947. This paper implements Swedish data cross-tabulated on 143
   industries (four-digit level) and 70 labour market regions for 1975-99
   to examine empirically the degree of concentration in the production of
   goods and services, the relationship between concentration and regional
   growth, and the role of regional entrepreneurship. To our knowledge,
   these issues have not been analysed previously at this level of
   aggregation. Ellison-Glaeser indexes and Gini location quotients reveal
   a geographical concentration in Swedish industry that is stronger than
   in the USA. The econometric results imply a 2-6\% higher growth in
   regionally concentrated industries. The effect is more pronounced for
   knowledge-intensive manufacturing, network industries and industries
   intensively using raw material. It is also found that regional
   entrepreneurship and regional absorption capacity are important
   explanations of regional growth, whereas the impact of the skill-level
   and economies of scale is more mixed.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on recent literature on the environmental impact of information
   and communication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet, this paper
   identifies three main types of effects: direct impacts of the production
   and use of ICTs on the environment (resource use and pollution related
   to the production of infrastructure and devices, electricity consumption
   of hardware, electronic waste disposal); indirect impacts related to the
   effect of ICTs on production processes, products and distribution
   systems (de-materialisation, substitution of information goods for
   material goods, and substitution of communication at a distance for
   travel); and structural/behavioural impacts, mainly through the
   stimulation of structural change and growth in the economy by ICTs, and
   through impacts on life styles and value systems. This paper argues that
   the diffusion and use of ICTs are leading to both positive and negative
   environmental impacts. However, because the effects of ICTs on economic
   activity are pervasive, their impacts on the environment are difficult
   to trace and measure. The paper argues for a need to move beyond the
   dichotomy between pessimism and optimism demonstrated in much of the
   emerging literature. Instead the relationship must be recognised as
   complex, interdependent, deeply uncertain and scale-dependent. (C) 2004

   length between subsequent radar pulses. Any deviation from this PRF will
   result in a nonuniform sampling of the synthetic aperture. This letter
   derives an innovative reconstruction algorithm and shows that an
   unambiguous reconstruction of a SAR signal is possible for nonuniform
   sampling of the synthetic aperture. This algorithm will also have great
   potential for multistatic satellite constellations as well as the dual

Abstract = {{The evaluation of the uncertainty of the result of a measurement
   performed by a DSP-based instrument is usually a complex and difficult
   task. The sources of uncertainty are the instrument input stage and the
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC), so that each input sample to the
   instrument can be considered a measurement result with its associated
   uncertainty. The uncertainty on the final measurement result is obtained
   as the combination of the uncertainty values of each sample, according
   to the measurement algorithm implemented on the digital signal
   processing (DSP) system. This paper proposes an innovative approach,
   based on the representation of the measurement result and its associated
   uncertainty in terms of random-fuzzy variables, that, after having
   suitably characterized the metrological performance of the input stage
   and analog-to-digital converter, provides an online estimation of the
   measurement uncertainty. The method has been validated experimentally,
   and the results of the experimental work are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Visual interface systems require object tracking techniques with
   real-time performance for ubiquitous interaction. A probabilistic
   framework for a visual tracking system, which robustly tracks targets in
   real-time using color and motion cues, is presented. The algorithm is
   based on particle filtering techniques of the I-Condensation filter. An
   innovation of the paper is the use of motion cues to guide the
   propagation of particle samples which are being evaluated using color
   cues. This results in a probabilistic blob tracking method which is
   shown to greatly outperform conventional blob trackers when in the
   presence of occlusion and clutter. A second innovation presented is the
   use of motion-based temporal signatures for the visual recognition of an
   initialization cue. This allows for passive initialization of the
   tracking system. The application presented here is the task of digital
   video annotation using a hand-held marking device. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One approach for reducing the inherent brittleness and flaw sensitivity
   of glass is to fabricate a composite material by incorporating particles
   or fibers in the glass matrix. In order to fully understand the
   toughening mechanisms in composites, it is useful to develop predictive
   models able to describe the mechanical behavior and its dependence on
   microstructure. To this aim, numerical models can be used in order to
   assess the effect of the glass-matrix composite microstructure on the
   effective macroscopic mechanical and fracture properties. An innovative
   microstructure-based finite element code is used to describe the
   mechanical performance of glass matrix composites. This code is able to
   convert digitized images of the material microstructure into a finite
   element grid, so that all microstructural details such as inclusion
   size, morphology and volume fraction can be incorporated in the model.
   In this study, a borosilicate glass matrix composite reinforced with
   molybdenum particles is characterized using the aforementioned
   microstructure-based FEM approach in terms of residual stresses and
   elastic properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an intelligent digital image correlation technique
   that uses genetic algorithms to measure surface displacements and
   strains. Speckle patterns are spray painted on the surface of interest
   and pictures taken before and during loading. Subpixel resolution,
   required for measuring displacements and strains accurately, is obtained
   by using interpolation methods. An innovative procedure based on genetic
   algorithms (GA) is used that has the potential to give the two
   displacements and four deformation gradients directly for a subset being
   investigated. This paper presents the algorithm for the six variables,
   but uses only the displacements (two variables) to calculate the 2-D
   strain fields. The genetic algorithms can guarantee a solution based on
   a comprehensive calibration procedure. The focus of this paper is the
   description of the GA routine used for the search process as well as the
   calibration scheme. Measurement results (ire presented for rigid-body
   displacement, 1-D and 2-D strain as proof of concept. Some potential
   applications for this work arc to extract surface displacements and
   strains on the surfaces of aircraft, spacecraft and reusable launch
   vehicles, submarine and ship hulls, civil infrastructures such as
   bridges, dams and buildings, and biomedical imaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation and increased precision of global positioning system
   (GPS) devices enable the technology to be used in new and innovative
   applications. In the past few years, the Kansas Department of
   Transportation collected spatial data on a highway system using annual
   GPS surveys. This research deals with the problem of handling very large
   amounts of geographical data (latitude, longitude, elevation, and
   additional attributes) that are not entirely consistent. This paper
   describes the methodology for cleaning up this large amount of data,
   condensing it, and generating a B-spline approximation of the highway.
   This data mining effort results in two separate two-dimensional models
   of the highway, represented as B-spline curves. The highway
   approximation methodology is validated using a comparison between the
   B-spline approximation and the actual design data for the highway.}},

Abstract = {{The deployment of IPv6 has become an issue of strategic importance for
   many economies, and telecom operators and ISPs play a key role in
   ensuring the availability of this new protocol on broadband access
   networks. It cannot be denied that the complexities exist in deploying
   IPv6 in an IPv4 world. Knowing this, telecom operators and ISPs have to
   ensure a viable transition strategy that takes into account transparent
   interoperability and mature integrated functionalities for deploying
   advanced applications on both IPv4 and IPv6 This potent combination will
   enable operators and ISPs to exploit the richer services offered by IPv6
   while interoperating IPv4 during this long transition period, creating a
   new business model that will generate return on investment without
   waiting for the whole world to be fully IPv6 deployed.
   Only the use of IPv6 at the end-user site can drive differentiated
   services, achieving returns in not only investments, but also in
   services innovation and flexible communication solutions. So both IPv4
   and IPv6 protocols have now to be implemented on digital subscriber line
   access networks. Solutions are mature and are beginning to be deployed.}},

Abstract = {{In degraded ecosystems where the impact on wildlife and the destruction
   of natural systems is high, restoration becomes a critical component of
   recovery. Monitoring restoration activities plays a key role in
   determining end points for restoration and assessing effectiveness.
   Appropriate monitoring of major systems, particularly in assessing
   vegetation reestablishment and slope stabilization, requires a long-term
   commitment to annual assessment of change and improvement over time.
   However, intrinsic factors built into government or public management
   systems, such as budgeting and staffing limitations, limit the ability
   for long-term monitoring of critical restoration projects. In the
   research reported in this article, we devised and assessed a new remote
   method for assessing restoration success and tested it on restoration
   and monitoring requirements in Lyell Island, British Columbia. We
   developed a system (the oblique data fusion system {[}ODFS]) to extract
   spatial information from oblique aerial video imagery. The ODFS enables
   low-cost change detection and database updates at a range of operational
   scales. System tests show an absolute spatial accuracy on the order of
   +/-2.1 m. The evaluation, based on digitized historical data, ground
   surveys, and the ODFS-derived data, indicates that the landslide rate
   (new area/year) tapered off following treatment; after 5 years it had
   been reduced by a factor of 3 relative to the background rate. The
   recovery is deemed sufficient to initiate secondary restoration tasks.
   The evaluation demonstrates the accuracy and utility of the ODFS for
   long-term monitoring of landscape restoration efforts, particularly in
   remote areas. In conclusion, this new innovative method shows
   considerable promise for park managers.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{The use of drug-eluting stents (DES) has tackled the ``Achilles'
   heel{''} of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) like no innovation
   before: the restenosis following initially successful PCI of de novo
   stenoses. Today, with DES, the pivotal clinical parameter TVF (target
   vessel failure) is in the upper single-digit range for ``standard{''}
   lesions and 16\% for long lesions. Numerous studies have assessed the
   effects of various anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory substances,
   like Sirolimus, Tacrolimus, Everolimus, ABT-578, Biolimus, Paclitaxel,
   QP2 as well as of other drugs, like Dexamethasone, 17-beta-Estradiol,
   Batimastat, Actinomycin-D, Methotrexat, Angiopeptin, Tyrosinkinase
   inhibitors, Vincristin, Mitomycin, Cyclosporin, and also the C-myc
   antisense technology (Resten-NG, AVI-4126). At the time of this
   analysis, four DES are CE-certified and commercially available in
   Europe: The Cypher stent, releasing Sirolimus from a polymer (Cordis,
   J\&J), the Taxus stent, releasing Paclitaxel from a polymer
   (Boston-Scientific), the V-Flex stent, releasing Paclitaxel without a
   polymer (Cook) and the Dexamet stent, releasing Dexamethasone from a PC
   coating (Abbott). Since more DES will be CE-certified soon, an
   increasing challenge vexes interventional cardiologists and health care
   providers: Which DES should be chosen for routine patient care? A
   prerequisite for assessing the efficacy of DES are randomized,
   controlled trials. Registries, even with strong monitoring, are limited
   by the known restrictions, comparing data to historical controls. At the
   time of this analysis, only three drugs had proven their efficacy in 13
   randomized studies in 5669 patients: Paclitaxel, Sirolimus and
   Everolimus, with 3815 patients in Paclitaxel studies, 1748 patients in
   Sirolimus studies and 106 patients in Everolimus studies. For further
   analysis, it makes sense to divide the primary endpoints into
   non-clinical and clinical endpoints. Non-clinical primary endpoints are
   usually angiographic parameters, like the percentage of DS (diameter
   stenosis, ASPECT, ELUTES), the in-stent LLL (late lumen loss, RAVEL,
   FUTURE-II), the in-stent MLD (minimal lumen diameter, E-SIRIUS,
   C-SIRIUS) or, like in TAXUS-II, the IVUS-determined percentage of volume
   obstruction. Clinical primary endpoints were either MACE (major adverse
   cardiac events, TAXUS-I, FUTURE-I), TVF (target vessel failure,
   DELIVER-I, SIRIUS) or TVR (target vessel revascularization, TAXUS-IV und
   TAXUS-VI). As ASPECT, ELUTES and DELIVER-I have shown, even a
   statistically significant effect on an angiographic primary endpoint
   does not necessarily translate into a significant clinical effect, which
   is completely absent in some such cases. Since it is not the goal of PCI
   to improve angiographic parameters but rather to improve patients'
   outcome, the choice of DES for routine treatment should be based on the
   results of randomized controlled studies with a clinical primary
   endpoint at an appropriate time interval. At the present time, these
   criteria have been met by only the Cypher and the Taxus stents.}},

Abstract = {{India's post-independence policy of using science and technology for
   national development, and investment in research and development
   infrastructure resulted in success in space, atomic energy, missile
   development and supercomputing. Use of space technology has impacted
   directly or indirectly the vast majority of India's billion plus
   population. Developments in a number of emerging technologies in recent
   years hold the promise of impacting the future of ordinary Indians in
   significant ways, if a proper policy and enabling environment are
   provided. New telecom technologies-a digital rural exchange and a
   wireless access system-are beginning to touch the lives of common
   people. Development of a low-cost handheld computing device, use of
   hybrid telemedicine systems to extend modern healthcare to the
   unreached, and other innovative uses of IT at the grassroots also hold
   promise for the future. Biotechnology too has the potential to deliver
   cost-effective vaccines and drugs, but the future of GM crops is
   uncertain due to growing opposition. Some of these emerging technologies
   hold promise for future, provided a positive policy and enabling
   environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Both for scientific analyses and for practical applications methodical
   developments are desirable for identifying and measuring compression
   wood of Norway Spruce. The objective of the present study was to develop
   and to test an innovative method for identifying and measuring
   compression wood. Methods of digital image analysis using digital
   photographs of discs of Norway Spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) permit,
   to detect and to identify independently compression wood areas within
   single annual rings, and to calculate their area, the position given as
   an angle of the deviation to the direction of North and the distance
   from the pith. Furthermore the total area of the discs can be
   determined, so that the compression wood areas can be converted to
   proportions of the total disc area. The quantity of the images'
   inaccuracy, the so-called lens distortion, was tested within the frame
   of the study presented, however the inaccuracy given as a percentage
   amounts to less than 1\% and can therefore be neglected. Using this
   method it is possible to identify quickly, objectively and detailed
   compression wood of Norway Spruce, so that the knowledge about the
   distribution of compression wood in stems and in sawn timber as well can
   be extended.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the incessant progress observed in fixed and wireless
   terrestrial communication networks, satellite systems remain an
   appealing solution for broadcasting, point-to-point, and multicasting
   telecommunications, because of undemanding,customer equipment and wide
   coverage capability. In this scenario, digital video broadcasting via
   satellite (DVB-S) is recognized as one of the main market attractive
   telecommunication fields. Up to now, expensive discrete GaAs HEMT or FET
   devices have been used to build up circuitry for satellite applications
   at Ku-band. This article presents the first 12-GHz monolithic receiver
   for DVB-S applications, implemented in a low-cost silicon bipolar
   technology. The receiver is based on a superheterodyne architecture,
   employing a fully integrated LO. To comply with the severe LO phase
   noise requirement of -101 dBc/Hz at a 100 kHz offset from the carrier,
   an innovative VCO topology was used implementing a three-metal-layer
   integrated transformer. The performance parameters of the integrated
   receiver fulfill DVB-S standard specifications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents architectural and implementation innovations made to
   realize a self-contained front-end processor for any DS-CDMA-based
   system. At the heart of the ASIC is a highly flexible RAKE processing
   engine that utilizes a unique resource allocation technique for maximum
   flexibility. The front-end of the chip consists of a matched filter and
   an all digital timing and frequency recovery loop based on novel
   interpolation and direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) techniques.
   A highly configurable multipath combiner is used to generate the final
   demodulated symbols by combining contributions from different multipath
   in a maximal ratio combining scheme. The combiner is also instrumental
   in performing channel estimation/correction and in closing the loop on
   the timing and frequency recovery circuits. The chip also features a
   multipath searcher which performs an energy scan of the wireless channel
   to decide on new valid multipath. To minimize power consumption and
   enhance the flexibility of the architecture a unique data tagging
   technique is utilized to decouple the sampling rate of the incoming data
   from the processing frequency of different blocks of the ASIC.
   All resources are programmable via a microcontroller interface that
   provides firmware control over system resources. Furthermore, the
   architecture supports the concept of design reuse by enabling simple
   modular expansion as a means of increasing resources. The resulting
   layout area is 8.29 mm(2) in a 0.18-mum 1-poly 6-metal CMOS process and
   consists of 320 000 equivalent gates. The core consumes a total of 4.032
   mW in a typical load scenario including full demodulation of two RAKE
   fingers and simultaneous searching for new multipath.}},

   and completeness of input. Second, threshold gates with hysteresis are
   primary components, which are used to build logic gates, full adder, and
   registers. As an example, a 4 x 4 multiplier is constructed based on
   these threshold gates. Finally, an example of very-high-speed

Abstract = {{The field of higher education shows a jumble of alliances between fellow
   institutes. The alliances are strategic in kind and serve an
   economy-of-scales concept. A large scale is a prerequisite for
   allocating the budgets for new educational methods and technologies in
   order to keep the educational services up-to-date. All too often,
   however, strategic alliances remain no more than dead letters, feted by
   boards of management, but lacking innovative power. The current paper
   reviews the K-Web case, one of few successful strategic alliances in
   education in the Netherlands. The K-Web alliance started in 1997 and
   aimed at a joint development of digitized learning materials in the
   domain of knowledge engineering. At its start five universities in the
   Netherlands were involved; in 2002 more universities joined the
   alliance. Based on the K-Web case, this paper identifies and explains
   the critical factors for successful co-operation and proposes a number
   of guidelines for making strategic alliances work. The guidelines
   involve issues on governance, project management, the partners'
   autonomies, conflicting pedagogies and conflicting technologies. The
   K-Web strategy seems to indicate a passable route, which may be helpful
   for other alliances.}},

Abstract = {{Test power requirements for complex components are becoming stringent.
   The purpose of this paper is to reuse a recently proposed RT ( Register
   Transfer) Level test preparation methodology to drive innovative
   Low-Energy (LE)/Low-Power ( LP) BIST solutions for digital SoC ( System
   on a Chip) embedded cores. RTL test generation is carried out through
   the definition of a reduced set of partially specified input vectors (
   masks), leading to a high correlation between multiple detection of RTL
   faults and single detection of likely physical defects. The methodology
   is referred as masked-based BIST, or m-BIST. BIST quality is evaluated
   considering three attributes: test effectiveness (TE), test length (TL)
   and test power (TP). LE BIST sessions are defined as short test
   sequences leading to high values of RT-level IFMB metrics and low-level
   Defects Coverage ( DC). The energy and power of the BIST sessions, with
   and without mask forcing, is computed. It is shown that, by forcing
   vectors with the RTL masks, short BIST sessions, with low energy and
   with a comparable ( or smaller) average power consumption, as compared
   to pseudo-random test, are derived. The usefulness of the methodology is
   ascertained using the VeriDOS simulation environment and modules of the
   CMUDSP and TORCH ITC' 99 benchmark circuits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the initial acquisition for the UMTS-FDD W-CDMA
   standard. It presents an innovative cell searcher design optimized for
   acquisition speed and low power consumption {[}1]. The proposed
   architecture relies on a memory-based digital matched filter with
   permuted processing order. We can reconfigure the same filtering
   hardware to process the three steps of the UMTS-FDD initial cell search,
   due to a thorough HW/SW codesign, in particular the implementation of an
   innovative algorithm for the second step of the initial acquisition. The
   searcher can also perform other functions such as initial delay
   profiling, neighboring cell search and idle-mode timing alignment, which
   are typically carried out, at least partially, by the Rake receiver.
   These additional capabilities allow for further system-level power
   savings because they avoid activating the Rake and reduce the RF
   front-end working time to a bare minimum.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes work aimed at combining 3D ultrasound with
   full-field digital mammography via a semi-automatic prototype ultrasound
   scanning mechanism attached to the digital mammography system gantry.
   Initial efforts to obtain high x-ray and ultrasound image quality
   through a compression paddle are proving successful. Registration
   between the x-ray mammogram and ultrasound image volumes is quite
   promising when the breast is stably compressed. This prototype system
   takes advantage of many synergies between the co-registered digital
   mammography and pulse-echo ultrasound image data used for breast cancer
   detection and diagnosis. In addition, innovative combinations of
   advanced US and X-ray applications are being implemented and tested
   along with the basic modes. The basic and advanced applications are
   those that should provide relatively independent information about the
   breast tissues. Advanced applications include x-ray tomosynthesis, for
   3D delineation of mammographic structures, and non-linear elasticity and
   3D color flow imaging by ultrasound, for mechanical and physiological
   information unavailable from conventional, non-contrast x-ray and
   ultrasound imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Systems on Chip are becoming extremely complex integrated circuits,
   containing tens or hundreds of analog, RF and digital blocks. For most
   applications, they have to present extremely low power consumption. It
   is the case, for instance, in ad hoc networks for which 100 or 1000 SoC
   nodes have to sense their environment, do some processing and send by
   radio some information to adjacent nodes in a multi-hop fashion to reach
   finally a base station. The design of such SoC nodes, to achieve the
   required extremely low power consumption, has to performed first at the
   system level, including low power communication protocols and data
   routing through the network, node wake-up strategies, low-power software
   and operating systems, innovative solutions for the sensor part,
   flexible or reconfigurable and very low power digital processing,
   low-power networks on chip for the communication between embedded
   processors and memories, as well as low power RF front-ends. In
   addition, due to the impressive technology pace, new problems have to be
   solved for the design of SoCs, such as the interconnect delays,
   reliability and the dramatic increase of the static power Some
   techniques, considered as the most efficient, of dynamic as well as
   static power reduction are described. It is however shown that the
   design of SoCs in 130 nm and below will impact dramatically the design
   methodologies, mainly due the static power increase. Finally, if today
   most SoCs are powered by batteries, alternative sources of energy are
   reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{A single-chip dual-band 5.15-5.35-GHz and 2.4-2.5-GHz zero-IF
   transceiver for IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLAN systems is fabricated on a
   0.18-mum CMOS technology. It utilizes an innovative architecture
   including feedback paths that enable digital calibration to help
   eliminate analog circuit imperfections such as transmit and receive I/Q
   mismatch. The dual-band receive paths feature a 4.8-dB (3.5-dB) noise
   figure at 5.25 GHz (2.45 GHz). The corresponding sensitivity at 54 Mb/s
   operation is -76 dBm for 802.11a and -77 dBm for 802.11g, both referred
   at the input of the chip. The transmit chain achieves output I-dB
   compression at 6 dBm (9 dBm) at 5 GHz (2.4 GHz) operation. Digital
   calibration helps achieve an error vector magnitude (EVM) of -33 dB (-31
   dB) at 5 GHz (2.4 GHz) while transmitting -4 dBm at 54 Mb/s. The die
   size is 19.3 mm(2) and the power consumption is 260 mW for the receiver
   and 320 mW (270 mW) for the transmitter at 5 GHz (2.4 GHz) operation.}},
